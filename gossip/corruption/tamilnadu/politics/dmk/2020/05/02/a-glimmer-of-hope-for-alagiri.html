<p>Yesterday I think a news circulated that Joy Alukkas owner died in middle east possibly due to Corona. The fact is some other guy called Joy Arakkal died there. Just imagine how happy Alagiri, a son of Karunadhi would have felt if he even heard this fake news, and thought it was true.</p>

<p>The story/gossip goes like this Joy Alukkas was about to open a branch in Madurai, before the day of opening, government officials there dug a trench before it claiming they have to do some corporation work there. It seems that Alagiri had asked bribe from them, they had refused to pay, so he decided to teach him a lesson.</p>

<p>Soon it was said that top rowdyâ€™s close to Alagiri came to know that an assassination team has been formed to finish off Alagiri, and it will take place before the opening of Joy Alukkas next day. The person who planned this was Dawood Ibrahim, a friend of Joy Alukkas, the gossip even goes that Dawood had invested in Joy. Confirmed the news was real Alagiri surrendered, the roads were mended, and Joy Alukkas opened as though nothing had happened.</p>

<p>It is also said that its because of this the DMK leadership was shaken and ultimatum was given to Alagiri by Dawood that he must not even dream of entering into any kind of politics.</p>

<p>Just imagine who was Alagiri, the unshakable in Madurai, Stalin was nothing before him, we did not even know about Kanimozhi or something like that existed, and imagine how he fell almost because of no reason. Yes Alagiriâ€™s men burned journalist in Dinakaranâ€™s office which was part of DMK group, but I donâ€™t think that would have contributed to his fall. I donâ€™t think DMK or AIADMK value lives of people working in their party or in the businesses in which they have invested. A good threat by a terrorist would have shaken them.</p>

<p><strong>Why I feel they donâ€™t value life</strong></p>

<p>Imagine Stalinâ€™s friend, he dies all of a sudden and people say itâ€™s cyanide poisoning, looks like key witnesses in 2G case too have died in similar way by consuming cyanide.</p>

<p>Imagine Jayalaithaâ€™s case, looks like some employees in Kodanadu died in mysterious accident. DMK and AIADMK are regimes which are no different from Noth Koreaâ€™s Kim dynasty, itâ€™s we who people who think they are enemies and vote for one now and vote for other then. They are very clear in how to loot us and are super successful.</p>

<p><strong>Why dont you avoid Joy Alukkas?</strong></p>

<p>I donâ€™t buy gold. Itâ€™s because I believe gold has no value and is only worth to build toilets, but yes gold is a valuable element to scientist, itâ€™s inert nature finds use in space science and in electronics because of its conductivity, but think whats the use of buying it.</p>

<p>Economically as a storage Gold is good, but to convert currency into Gold and back to currency is a big process, plus they wonâ€™t give you the market value if you sell it back, I think you have to be a big trader for that. Better consider bitcoin which is mathematically secure.</p>

<p>Please research how people are treated in gold mines, and since there could be terrorist who are investors in these jewel shops, why fund them to kill us? Please think.</p>
