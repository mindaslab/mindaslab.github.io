<p>Colleges far from being temple of knowledge are becoming like temples of today. Temples offer no proof of God but the pundits and priests use blind faith to extract money from the faithful. In a similar fashion Valliammai (just one among many engineering colleges in Chennai) illegally collects money from the students. Here is a insider report.</p>

<p>The first thing this college flouts is the donation rule. According to university norms, no college must collect donation, instead they are only eligible to collect fees from students. But for SRM Valliammai College, parents are forced to pay Rs 2 Lakhs as donation. Nothing can be done about it, for years and university authorities haven’t taken a single action on that college. WHY?</p>

<p>Here is another two tricks the college employs to gain more and more money. A student can bunk any lecture / class, but has to pay Rs 15 as a fine. If he does not, his parents would be informed! Another thing thing this college does is to collect Rs 200 if some one has failed a periodical (internal) test. This they say is for conducting the retest. This is a clear violation of university norms. If any one fails to pay these money they will bve publicly abused in college. Anna University has never said to colleges to collect money for students bunking class and failing test. A college is entitled to collect only tuition fees and nothing else. But since Anna University is unimaginably corrupt, colleges can run their own gunda raj in their campuses and thats what is happening here.</p>

<p>If you are parent reading this blog think about this. Are you fit to be a parent if you put your son or daughter in a place where the norms are flouted? Or will you want them to be nursed in a legal environment?</p>
