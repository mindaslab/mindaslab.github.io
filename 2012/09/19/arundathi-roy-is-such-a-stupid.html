<p>Looks like no one is reading Arundathiâ€™s books now and her fame is slipping down, to make it up she is acting in a stupid way. She wakes up one day and sayâ€™s Kashmir should be granted freedom. For what? For it to become a muslim radical state like Pakistan and pour in more blood thirsty terrorists into our lands. History has shown that Muslims donâ€™t think, they suppress thought using their religion as pretext. The days when Islamist were a pioneers of science are gone. Now according to muslims they must declare some one as enemy and try all possible means to kill them. They get some joy in it, like one gets in hunting. If one muslim dares to use his brain, he is branded as anti-Islamic and is branded to be killed. Sick religion.</p>

<p>OK, this blog is not about religion, this is about what Arundathi Roy said about nuclear power in India. She is against it, she famously asks â€˜how the Indian government thats unable to dispose household garbage can dispose nuclear waste?â€™. Well this question though seems like a good one is utterly stupid. This shows how much Roy knows about science and how much she has to learn before speaking or asking.</p>

<p>First the volume of household waste is too huge. Nuclear waste on the other hand is quiet small but is dangerous to handle. Second, the guy who handles municipal waste wonâ€™t handle nuclear waste. It will be handled by professionals who know to handle it. Many countries like Japan rely on nuclear power, more than 70% of their power is nuclear. Renewable energy costs and we as a poor nation cannot afford it in large scale. Even when Fukushima occurred, not many died!</p>

<p>Next about our nuclear program, we do not waste our nuclear waste. We are so starved of nuclear resources, we reprocess it and hence much of it goes back into reactors producing power. Even those that cannot be used for any other purpose can be sealed properly in containers that will last for 1000â€™s of years and dumped into deepest part of the ocean. Even if radio activity mixes with water say after 1500/- years, it will get so diluted that it wonâ€™t have more effect than background radiation we already have naturally.</p>

<p>Well what to say. Stupids are stupids. Wonder how much stupid a human should be if he/ she happen to read Royâ€™s books ðŸ™‚</p>
