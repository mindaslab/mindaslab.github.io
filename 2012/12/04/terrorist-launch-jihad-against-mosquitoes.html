<p>Today terrorist found out that Ajmal Kasab who carried out the attacks on Mumbai, India was not hanged by the Indian government, but he had succumbed to Dengue (a fever caused by Mosquito bite). Indian government which has to kill him by hanging was taken by surprise about his sudden death and claimed that they had hanged him secretly.</p>

<p>Now terrorist who had planned an attack on India have refocussed their attention to eradicating Mosquitoes. “Mosquitoes are un-Islamic and they must be killed” claimed a statement from Mecca, and terrorist have vowed to kill all mosquitoes.</p>

<p>Pakistan as usual has vowed to support terrorist, today Pakistan’s ministry of defence and its intelligence chief have flown to USA to raise funding from Mr. Obama for this operation. “Pakistan is a natural friend of USA” they said before boarding planes bound there. Mean while anti terror movements have launched “Save Mosquito Campaign”. Terrorism destroys the world they say, the world can be won only by peace and winning hearts. “We must win the hearts and minds of mosquitoes” said a statement from Greenpeace, “we must make them realize that their bite hurts, and they can’t go on biting us”.</p>

<p>Palestinians have started to launch rockets into Israel and have said that they would kill all mosquitoes that carry Jewish blood. Israel has carried out counter strikes into Palestine. An Israeli defence expert who master minded the construction of walls around Palestine has resigned as these walls and barb wires have failed to stop Palestine mosquitoes coming into Israel.</p>

<p>Obama has struck a note against Iran, getting nuclear weapon will destroy all mosquitoes in the vicinity of blast, killing mosquitoes will help terrorist, and hence Iran is aiding terror and so its nuclear program should be stopped or USA will wage a war on Iran he stressed.</p>

<p>Syraian troops have carried out bombings on 10 more rebel cities citing that they are committing acts of terror by killing mosquitoes in their cities.</p>

<p>That’s all I know about Terrorist Jihad against mosquitoes. Will report more when I get info about it.</p>
