&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cobalt is a rare metal essential for lithium-ion batteries due to its thermal stability, with most production from the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cobalt is also crucial for animal life as it is a key component of cobalamin (Vitamin B12), vital for DNA, fatty acid, and amino acid production.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Animals cannot synthesize Vitamin B12 and rely on consuming it from food, a dependency that evolved because synthesizing B12 is a complex and energy-intensive biological process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plants do not require B12 as they have a different biochemical pathway for DNA, fatty acid, and protein synthesis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to severe health issues, including problems with red blood cell production, neurological problems, and fatigue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The typical Indian diet often leads to B12 deficiency due to low per capita meat consumption, as B12 is primarily found in animal sources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To ensure adequate B12 intake, options include consuming red meat and seafood, fortified foods, or supplements, especially for those on vegan diets or with culturally limited animal product intake.&lt;/li&gt;

I drove to Medavakkam’s Yamohideen briyani and it was closed. Though expensive, its meat quality seems to be good compared to other briyani houses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I drove down the road, towards Shollinganallur, took a U-turn, there was Khalids. Buying briyani there was a disappointment. In Yamohideen, you had lot of meat for rice, really nice to eat, that’s how briyani should be. But in Khalids there were just two pieces of meat, it was totally disappointing. Th price in Khalids was disappointing too, it was equivalent to Yamohideen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will never goto Khalids again. They just seem to rip people off. I must say though the taste of briyani in Khalids was not bad.

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Renewables have surpassed coal as the top global electricity source, although progress varies, accelerating in developing nations while slowing in the U.S. and EU.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Smaller nations are rapidly adopting clean energy, electric vehicles, and battery storage, often driven by economic factors like reducing reliance on expensive fossil fuels and improving grid reliability, rather than solely climate change concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bhutan, traditionally hydro-reliant, is diversifying with solar, wind, and biomass to combat seasonal power drops and meet industrial demand, transitioning from a winter importer to a balanced energy mix.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nepal, prompted by a 2015 blockade, is aggressively shifting to electric vehicles, powered by domestic hydropower, to reduce import dependence and air pollution, with significant growth in EV adoption despite political instability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sri Lanka’s severe economic crisis in 2022-2023 highlighted its energy vulnerabilities, pushing the nation to rapidly expand solar and wind power, aiming for 70% renewable energy by 2030, supported by AI-based grid integration and inclusive projects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Maldives is replacing diesel generators with solar arrays and battery storage across its islands to mitigate high import costs and oil price volatility, prioritizing economic survival and community benefits in its net-zero by 2030 roadmap.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The text describes the traditional craft of making “varq” (edible silver and gold leaf) in Hyderabad’s Old City, highlighting the sensory experience of finding a workshop through the rhythmic hammering sound.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Varq, used as an edible decoration for sweets and other dishes, has a long history in India, with mentions in ancient Ayurvedic texts for its medicinal properties and later refined in Mughal courts as a symbol of luxury and status.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Historically, varq was made by hand-beating silver between sheets of ox gut or cowhide, a meticulous process passed down through generations of artisans.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Despite rising silver prices leading some sweet shops to use cheaper machine-made or aluminum substitutes, the tradition of hand-beaten varq persists, with a few remaining artisans preserving this delicate art.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The term “varq” itself has Sanskrit and Persian origins, both meaning “leaf” or “sheet,” reflecting its ancient roots and cultural significance across different eras in India.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shellfish are presented as a superior alternative to fish for combating sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shellfish protein is highly bioavailable and rich in amino acids like leucine, effectively stimulating muscle protein synthesis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are packed with essential minerals (zinc, selenium, iron) and B vitamins, which act as “activators” for muscle health and cellular processes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shellfish contain taurine, an amino acid that protects muscles from oxidative stress, supports mitochondrial health, and improves endurance, crucial for aging bodies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unlike larger fish, shellfish are low in the food chain and generally do not accumulate heavy metals like mercury, making them a safe and clean food source.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regular shellfish consumption, combined with appropriate exercise and lifestyle, can significantly reduce sarcopenia and frailty, promoting vitality in old age.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An anti-sarcopenia lifestyle encompasses not only diet (like shellfish) but also movement, adequate sleep, hydration, inflammation management, good digestion, hormonal balance, sunlight exposure, and social connection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shellfish contribute to overall health beyond muscles by supporting nerves (B12), protecting joints and bones (muscle pull), and aiding brain function (blood sugar regulation).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The text emphasizes that sarcopenia is preventable and reversible, not an inevitable part of aging, and small, consistent choices, including incorporating shellfish, can make a significant difference.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ultimate vision is an active, independent, and joyful aging experience, free from the limitations often associated with muscle loss, made possible by a holistic approach centered on nutrient-dense foods like shellfish.&lt;/li&gt;

I am in software industry, and we programmers have been asked often the question: ‘what is our plan?’, ‘when is the deadline?’, and we do give a plan and estimated deadline, and most of the time, it won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are ignorant feel bad about it. In IT industry, people who work are less stupid, and usually the stupidest person gets to the top due to Dunning Kruger effect. So they don’t have intelligence to separate between plan and real world happenings. So if a plan fails or slips, the intelligent person who did the plan is put to a toss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is complex. You don’t plan to brush your teeth, it happens, you don’t plan to breathe. You plan only when you are not sure, you plan only when you are not made up for the task, when you are unsure. That is you plan only when there is element(s) of uncertainty, or some difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not intelligent for a person to take a plan as execution, instead it should be treated as communication. This is what a person is going to do. It might happen happen in the way planned, but there is a good chance that it won’t, the course might change, we might even scrub it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wise person sees plan, and pads it up with more resources, to take the shock(s) of reality, he also plans for failure.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I think Eisenhower said something like, though it does not work, plan is essential.

&lt;p&gt;If you know the right facts, you can easily kill blind faith. Buddha as I know did not like Hinduism, the tradition of sacrifices, the tradition of yagnas (sacred fire offerings) didn’t appeal to him. He didn’t know what was reality, and why we suffered? So, he went on long quest to ask his inner self. In the end he emerged with something that would kill any faith that’s based on God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see in religions like Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism etc, there is God, depending on your good or bad deeds, God rewards or punishes you. If you are rewarded, you feel happy, if you are punished, you feel sad. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Buddha found out the powerful fact that happiness and sadness lies entirely within you. You can turn it on or off as per your will. That is you can stay happy, and calm, all the time if you wished too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can stay happy all the time, what can God do to you even if it exist? Of course, people in those times did not have the scientific tools to disprove God, they wouldn’t even be able to explain what lightning was, they had no idea about nuclear fusion that powers the sun. So Buddha said, it didn’t matter if God exists or not. If you can take control of your feelings, then God doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly God became powerless before this fact. I wonder what would have happened if these thoughts had reached Arabia, there could have been no Christianity, and no Islam. Jews would have struggled to hold ground against such a powerful fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these thoughts had reached Afghanistan and Iran, Zoroastrianism would have had tough time, Zorastrians invented the concept of God, may be single God (Ahura Mazda), they invented the concept of heaven and hell, and these concepts stuck with later religions. What would have happened if they discovered that this God was powerless before an well trained brain which can control its thoughts and feelings? It’s really funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They might have got mad, wanted to destroy India and Buddhism.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They might accept Buddhism and abandoned their religion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They could have coexisted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They could have  formed a new mixed religion.&lt;/li&gt;

This is the writing on the wall I could see. The recent culprit is actor Vijay. He has killed 40 people, and nothing happens to him. He has failed to lead, after the deaths happened in his rally, he proved himself coward and fled to Chennai rather than stand with people who have suffered and died for him. Neither Vijay, nor his party TVK, seems to have no inkling of guilt, they are unapologetic till now. They have announced price for lives lost, and price for injury, thats it. As the courts once said, Vijay is not a true life hero, just a hero before the cameras. Vijay however filed a case and made the court retract this statement. But the statement made by the court is the truth, time has proven it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of killing innocent life’s, and politicians being unapologetic is a long one in Tamilnadu, the so called Tamilian leaders have been no beeter than the Brits in this regard. Now let’s see one by one, how major politicians killed innocent people and still remain unapologetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stalin&quot;&gt;Stalin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tamilnadu under stalin I believe has at least 28 lockup deaths. Not so long ago, I think 63 people died in drinking illicit liquor. Stalin who was heartbroken by this 40 deaths in Vijay’s rally, stood firm and unapologetic when he killed these people. He simply didn’t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before coming to power Stalin started to kill Tamilians. Watch his election rally, it took place in covid times, and DMK took no measures in preventing spreading of the disease. Once elected into power, Stalin shamelessly asked Tamils to donate, so that he can fight the disease which he spread. Not even EPS apposed to this evil preelection campaigns of Stalin, because he too followed no covid guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an Airshow conducted in Chennai, it was very poorly organized and 5 people died in it. The DMK government closed the mater and swept the dirt under the rugs. They are unapologetic till now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;eps&quot;&gt;EPS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said before, EPS too campaigned as though there was no covid, had no regard for Tamilian lives. He is famous for killing atleast 12 activist who protested against the Sterlite copper factory in Thuthukudi. ADMK and EPS are still unapologetic about it, he played a drama to the media that, its only after watching the news that he knew the murders had been committed. The whole state knows that police will not resort to firing without orders from the CM, Its not simple matter to fire on people, it should be done only after lot of approvals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in EPS time that all people who were associated with the Kodanaadu Jayalaitha property robbery case died in mysterious circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In EPS era too there were lockup deaths, the most famous case was that of Felix, and Jerald I think. Father and son duo was tortured in lockup and lilled by the Tamilandu police, just because they had verbal spat. None who is associated with that case is hanged yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Stalin and EPS are super weak CM’s who are unable to control the Tamilnadu police, no matter how barbaric the police becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;karunanidhi&quot;&gt;Karunanidhi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2G case was going on, Kanimozhi was in a soup. The civil war in Srilanka was on, the Sinhala forces had the upper hand. As a leader of Tamils, Karunanidhi should have stood up, prevented the defeat of the LTTE, but he stood down because he need to concentrate and save Kanimozhi from the 2G case. Then DMK threaded the line of Pranab Mukerjee and said that the war was over, while Sinhala troops were mascaraing Tamils en-masse. Finally this led to the death of Velu Pillai Prabhakaran, the hope of Tamils. Even Prabhakaran’s young son was killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to save his girl, Karunanidhi wiped of an entire Tamil civilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jayalalitha&quot;&gt;Jayalalitha&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jayalalitha is one of the worst Chief Minister’s ever to rule in india according to me. She cared nothing about people. Traffic need to wait for hours, just because she wanted to take a walk on the roads. She was shameless, totally irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was some holy festival called Mahamagam. Jayalaitha had gone to some crowded place to take a dip in some holy pond or something. There was a private area for her to be drenched in holy water. Her arrival itself added more congestion to the crowds. Just to disperse the crowds, its said that some police guy called Walter Devaram shot rounds in the air, the crowd panicked. There was stampeed, and people died. ADMK is still unapologetic till now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Periyaar was right when he said that independence of India is a black day. He said the only the skin color of the rulers will change. Just like General Dire has no concern for life and killed a lot in Janian-wallah-bagh, India’s post independence leaders have no concern for the lives of people. They are intoxicated by the power, wealth and richness, and they think they are untouchables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A society is like a stew, scum floats to the top often and it need to be stirred often to break the scum. I feel that we Indians are  ot stirring up India often, we are not scaring politicians often, neither we have &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/01/31/dynamic-democracy.html&quot;&gt;Dynamic Democracy&lt;/a&gt;, and we have decided to be their slaves forever.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">If you are a powerful (wo)man in Tamilnadu, you can get away with the murder.

I couldn’t sleep in the rocking motion, and because of the the stale air in the bus. It was hell. The next day I had to attend a tech summit and I had to keep my concentration alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months before that, may be even a year ago, I had to travel in a sleeper bus in Maharashtra, it was equally hell. I just couldn’t sleep. We arrived at a destination at 2PM, I was so disillusioned because of the sleeplessness, I thought we arrived at a 5-star hotel. It was only the next day I really found out it was marriage hall. But the trip was memorable, Maharashtrian hospitality aced!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do wonder how people travel in buses? And I also wonder if people needs to travel in buses? Why can’t we have lot of cheap Aircrafts that enable us to travel between cities? Yes I do hate airport checkups, but air tavel does save time. Yes economy class seats are crampy, but its for a short duration. We need faster transports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of doing it is opening more airports, for some reason, India is very slow in that. Another thing is to privatize railways so that we have better trains, and trains that run faster. Plus we also need innovative transports like airships, and helicopters a lot, and cheap. Why not autonomous aircrafts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream where a person should be able to go from any city from India, to any other city, within 2 hours, and that too whenever he wants. This will change the dynamics and truly integrate India. I want the busses, the old clunky, rocky way of travel, to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the first stage of killing slow busses is more airports, and air travel, this also includes airships, and helicopters that need less infrastructure. The second stage is faster trains that rival aircrafts. The killer stages wil be hyperloops, flying cars etc. I feel India is too slow in providing revolutionary transports to its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A few months back, a friend of mine took me to Banglore in a bus.

The next day I had to attend a tech summit and I had to keep my concentration alive.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Proud of Chennai’s no honking tradition</title><link href="/2025/09/16/proud-of-chennai-s-no-honking-tradition.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Proud of Chennai&apos;s no honking tradition" /><published>2025-09-16T21:04:00+05:30</published><updated>2025-09-16T21:04:00+05:30</updated><id>/2025/09/16/proud-of-chennai-s-no-honking-tradition</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2025/09/16/proud-of-chennai-s-no-honking-tradition.html">&lt;p&gt;I am born and brought up in Chennai. Yesterday evening I was driving from Medavakkm to Sithalapakkam, and I think I just herd only 1 bike honk, apart from that nothing. For reason unknown, people in Chennai have become civilized and don’t honk as much as say other cities in Tamilnadu or India. Drivers in my city seem  to observe the road and drive rather than honk and rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone follows this less, or no honking stuff. Especially people who do not have the privilege to get educated honk a lot, like cab divers, politicians etc, apart from them, and some uncivilized psychopaths, Chennai seems to be slipping into civilized driving culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure how long this will last, or if this culture will improve. Yes, chennai has its challenges, its filthy, its looted by both DMK, and ADMK, left, right and center. Only VIP areas are clean, with stray dogs, and so on, there is rampant use of drugs, and drug related violence, there seems to be a land mafia here, grabbing the lands of innocent. I think recently homicide, and murders have gone up. Yet among this darkness, I notice that Chennai’s roads are getting quieter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that people in the area I grew up, Adyar, exhibit very civilized driving culture. People around OMR too exhibit civilized driving culture. But as you move towards Tambaram, people drive like mad. I am not sure what is the cause of lack of civility?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I drive, old family members if they travel with me, often ask me, why I am not honking even at turnings, they simply don’t notice that I drastically slow down, observe and turn slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing is controllability of vehicles. With modern digital controls, we can control the vehicle in a ways that’s not possible say 15 years ago. Many cars today do not crash. I think all these things are contributing to safer and relaxed driving conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t expect other cities in Tamilnadu, and India to follow Chennai’s example. But I think it’s a good thing that Chennai is not following the example of other cities. I hope that people in Chennai will be more civilized in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I am born and brought up in Chennai.
