&lt;p&gt;I wonder how they think in 37 signals. According to me Ruby on Rails is a miracle web development framework. they selected very right language Ruby, they seem to have thought about how you can write very messy code with Ruby, so they put up a very opinionated framework called Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to think of learning Rails as learning to become an engine driver. Learning to walk is relatively easy; to go to a near by shop located at one’s street corner and buying few things, walking would suffice. If you want to goto a port and transport tonnes of coal to a power station 100 miles away you need a railway infrastructure, and that’s what Rails gives you. You need to learn about it all to become a Rails developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails promise’s one thing, if you obey it’s rules it would work fine, if you derail it, it’s just a pile of mess.  Being a Rails developer, to my astonishment I am seeing this promise come true again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog I am going to tell you how Rails was derailed many times in my career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;derailing-by-using-front-end-frameworks&quot;&gt;Derailing by using front end frameworks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails follows MVC architecture, the &lt;strong&gt;V&lt;/strong&gt; in that stands for View, yes Rails has got a view layer, and tremendous support for Ajax which can make pages dynamic and it has got this thing called Turbolinks till Rails 6 which makes clicking of links Ajax, and now it has got Turbo, a full fledged framework to support very dynamic pages that needs almost no refreshing. Using a front end framework is an anti-pattern. You are simply turning Rails into a  JSON or GraphQL source. If you do so decouple front end and back end development. Just use the Model and Controller in Rails and pump out data to be consumed by your devices like mobile app and front end framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a Rails developer to work on a  front end is like asking an engine driver to paint his train, no that won’t work. The paint job would be in a mess and would peel off any time. Rails developers are good at putting out HTML, JSON and GraphQL (that too when they know about it well). As of now not many Rails dev’s know GraphQL thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;derailing-thinking-that-full-stack-includes-design&quot;&gt;Derailing thinking that full stack includes design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again full stack does not include design. Designing requires a different kind of brain, it might also need to think about UI and UX. Rails is all about business logic delivered fast. Many people confuse that designing is a part of Rails and that gives us headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;derailing-by-using-unsupported-databases&quot;&gt;Derailing by using unsupported databases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Postgres is very much supported DB in Rails. The community has moved in that direction. I have seen projects where one uses Oracle or Microsoft SQL and see that Ruby does not work well with it. Use a data store that support Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also seen people using Mongo (or some weird NoSQL), and even Neo4j with Rails, and getting involved in productive bottlenecks. All I can say is you are a software engineer, think dude think. Don’t be dumb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your project has grown too large, try using something like Cockroach DB, that’s just drop in replacement to PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-activejob&quot;&gt;Use ActiveJob&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least in 3 project’s I saw Rails been used with Kafka, okay but hasn’t Rails got nicely integrated ActiveJob? The Rails community has realized the need of doing intensive tasks that could fail, and has provided an excellent abstraction layer. I see some companies using Sidekiq and ActivJob and processing nearly TB’s of machine generated data and generating more data due to it :D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kafka is great but integrate with Rails with a proper abstraction like an API where a Rails dev fires an API to create task and queries it to know its status. Kafka should be handled totally separate way. A Railway engineer should not worry about what happens to a parcel is delivered at a Railway station, messages to Kafka is like parcels a train delivers to a platform. Trying to push it into Rails may or may not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;follow-convection-over-configuration&quot;&gt;Follow convection over configuration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encountered a situation where emailing stuff was so abstracted from Rails, I had to define same email template in multiple locations. A lot of configuration should be set. I was given a reason for this, but I was not convinced. Use Rails convention. Never violate the rails way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails is battle tested, 37 signals and other top companies are using it, and they are iterating their products fast and moving along with trend. I believe they are right in many ways. So follow Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-creating-a-knowledge-base&quot;&gt;Not creating a knowledge base&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I do freelancing, I find in many projects the client fails to create knowledge base and documentation for his product. Never I have seen a document that says you need to have imagemagick installed on the server you are deploying, and that sucks. One should create a good enough knowledge base so that it gives lot of information to developers. If your developers are too techi and cannot write english, then hire some technical writers to assist them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never in a Rails project I have seen an architecture diagram describing if you need a redis connected to it, never have I seen a diagram if the current deployment is behind load balancers or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans can understand far better using diagrams than reading text, that too reading code is hard. So putting diagrams is not bad. May be consultancy should be formed to evaluate a companies tech knowledge base and reveal its shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tdd&quot;&gt;TDD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please! Yes do TDD 100%, please! Else forget about fast changes and upgrading your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails is very thought out, they have lasted the test of time, I think for two decades and they are still roaring like lions. I don’t know who chose the name Rails, but if you derail, things go awry like a real railway system. Either be on track, create knowledge for the driver to understand well when convention is broken, don’t break the convention too much so that it becomes hard for others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">mkcd Make and change directory</title><link href="/2022/05/07/mkcd-make-and-change-directory.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="mkcd Make and change directory" /><published>2022-05-07T21:09:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-05-07T21:09:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/05/07/mkcd-make-and-change-directory</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/05/07/mkcd-make-and-change-directory.html">&lt;p&gt;Often I run into a problem, I need to create a directory using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt; and I have to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; into it. Some times I need to create a directory structure like this: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/code/folder/sub_folder&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;folder&lt;/code&gt; might be missing or the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; might be missing. So I found the following shell command which will &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt; with padding and changes i.e &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to the created directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paste the line below in your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;function &lt;/span&gt;mkcd &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;eval cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;\$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$#\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;; }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; it as shown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; ~/.zshrc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the following command will create the directory structure and will change to it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;mkcd ~/code/folder/sub_folder

I am reading Clojure to build very complex, concurrent systems that deal with lot of data. Using OOPS for that is a pain, it collapses when we hit about 0.2 million lines of code. I had done recursion in Clojure and this is how it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-clojure highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;; recursion.clj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rest-elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;rest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first-element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first-element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print-array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rest-elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print-array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the program above we are printing an array element by element. The function we wrote for that is called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;print-array&lt;/code&gt;, note how at the end we are calling the same function from that function like this: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(print-array rest-elements)&lt;/code&gt;. Well, this is all good, but the book Getting Clojure says this will slow up the computer if you have lot of elements, instead it tells us to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;recur&lt;/code&gt; as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-clojure highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;; recursion-2.clj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;defn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print-array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first-element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rest-elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;rest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first-element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;recur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rest-elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print-array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;recur&lt;/code&gt; should be the last line of a function and so it is in the case above. As an OOP guy I find that bit disturbing that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;recur&lt;/code&gt; should be in the last line, but I found OOP disturbing while learning it being a C programmer.

&lt;p&gt;I am a programmer, like every programmer I want to finish a job quick for my client and get my pay with a smile. I was able to do it when I coded with PHP, I was able to do it when I coded in Ruby on Rails. In fact Ruby on Rails had a thing called RJS (Ruby Java Script). I don’t know who made it, but it was genius. In Rails it combined with Prototype and Scriptaculous and made writing front end a charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they moved to Coffeescript and jQuery, in my mind not a wise move, but it kind of worked, we were writing JavaScript-ish that sucked compared to RJS, but Coffeescript made it bit easy. I was presented with this learning curve to learn this jQuery. All this parent, child relationship made it suck, but I learned. I was still able to create apps faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today while developing a Rails app I don’t understand what’s going on. There is thing called webpack, yarn and I have to search for blogs to make jQuery and Twittter Bootstrap work with it. That’s pain, but once done productivity improves unless some idiot propose a brand new JavaScript library to be included so the project becomes cool. I personally thought going JavaScript way sucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I for long wished Opal became a part of Ruby on Rails. I wished code was easy to write as in the days of RJS. Today if you are writing software with Rails 5 or 6, you need to know about node, yarn, webpack and blah blah to be comfortable with it. It’s like a mini framework in this framework called Ruby on Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript has a philosophy that’s different than Ruby I suppose.  Ruby was clearly written to make programmers life easy, when I switched from PHP to Ruby I could see it. PHP ecosystem meant deployment happiness, which Rails robbed away from us, thus paving way for companies like Heroku to overcharge us, but when it comes to total cost of developing webpages, Rails was okay. Butt this JavaScript, my God! It would make atheist like me to think that there was a previous birth and I had done very bad things to inherit this super bad Karma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus reading that Ruby might run in the browser was a kind of faint light in a dark hell. A distant and very faint light, but better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to think, even though Microsoft is an ultra evil company, they developed Blazor &lt;a href=&quot;https://blazor.net&quot;&gt;https://blazor.net&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9BhbGbTsyeE?color=white&amp;amp;theme=light&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/iframe&gt;
     &lt;/figure&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have this vision of making developers build full webapps with just C# and thus avoid JavaScript. Isn’t that good? For a while I even thought of ditching Ruby on Rails and switching to Blazor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All hopes not lost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Rails developer I would say that all hopes are not lost, it’s possible to develop apps without writing much of JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
        &lt;source src=&quot;https://d1snj8sshb5u7m.cloudfront.net/Rails7.mp4 &quot; /&gt;
      Your browser does not support the video element.
      &lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see that Rails is getting matured. May be one day doing Rails project might be as good as doing a pure Ruby project. I have to go through this tutorial when I have free time &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hotrails.dev/turbo-rails&quot;&gt;https://www.hotrails.dev/turbo-rails&lt;/a&gt;. May be I can get off writing a web app with almost no JavaScript very soon. Let’s see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really pissed off creating web pages today. In India people jump into things without trying things out. People, even in small projects introduce Angular, React into front end without knowing who created it and why it was created. Today you are considered a full stack developer only if you know these JavaScript framework. May be one day a full stack developer would also include VHDL and chip design as their profile, after all webpages are served by Integrated Circuits which too are part of stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May be I will learn Julia (Python sucks for DataScience) or something, finish writing my DataScience book &lt;a href=&quot;https://cliz.in/dsbuk&quot;&gt;https://cliz.in/dsbuk&lt;/a&gt; and escape the world where we take stuff out and put into RDMS via web apps. I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May be I will learn Clojure, avoid JavaScript all together by using it in backend and using ClojureScript in front end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s nice to be in a world dominated by free software. We have lot of choices. It’s up to programming languages and frameworks now. Will they  help us create better web apps without relying upon JavaScript, or else they will make people mad and drive them away? Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Some time back, don’t know when I saw this post https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2022/04/03/ruby-3-2-0-preview1-released/ and I couldn’t sleep that night.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">R.N.Ravi crushes Tamils in Tamilnadu</title><link href="/2022/04/14/r-n-ravi-crushes-tamils-in-tamilnadu.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="R.N.Ravi crushes Tamils in Tamilnadu" /><published>2022-04-14T22:43:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-04-14T22:43:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/04/14/r-n-ravi-crushes-tamils-in-tamilnadu</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/04/14/r-n-ravi-crushes-tamils-in-tamilnadu.html">&lt;table&gt;

      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/R.N._Ravi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our politics is dominated by scoundrels, and R.N.Ravi is no different. Rather than respecting the constitution and being a governor who does his duties well, he is just obeying the BJP and delaying to sign laws passed by Tamilnadu government. The question is “why?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the second world war there was a massive famine in India. Winston Churchill had transported all Indian grains to England to feed their army and people. Millions of Indians died and Winston Churchill was awarded the Nobel Prize. So why the world turned a blind eye to massive deaths in India?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today everyone empathizes with Ukrainians, thats great, but the world forgot about Tamil genocide in Srilanka, the world barely remembers genocide of Kurds by Turkey and genocide conducted by Bokoharam. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple answer is they are not us. People empathize and want to uplift only people who they can associate with. It’s a natural phenomenon. That’s how human brans work. Those who cannot empathize with us should not be allowed to rule us. It’s that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We Tamils should never let BJP conquer us. For more than 5000 years, the Hindus have made us worship Gods in their language Sanskrit. Said that Tamil is the language of people born to prostitutes and so on. Now we see one who holds such kind of values is our governor, and a party that holds such kind of value, the BJP, is ruling India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BJP people are so blind that it’s said that it’s minister Nirmala Sitharaman when questioned about rising onion prices seems to have said that she is not bothered about it because she does not consume onions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BJP wants us to blindly believe that they are the ones who should rule all over India. They want us to believe that they are divine, unquestionable, unappeasable, because they have got this divine power by drinking cow urine and eating cow shit every day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those states that are ruled by parties that don’t eat shit and drink urine,
BJP is irritating the government by telling the governor to be a impediment to the government appointed by the people. This is pure murder of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We Tamils should take a note of it, we must talk, blog, vlog about it, so that the world knows about Modi and his BJP. Many think he is great, but none knows how he is destroying us Tamils in Tamilnadu. Modi is not one of us, and BJP people smelling his farts and eating his shit is not one of us too. They are just Sanskrit speaking Winston Churchills. The world must know that Modi ruled India is not constitution respecting democracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">R.N.Ravi</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Finding outer products of vectors - Python Vs Julia</title><link href="/2022/04/03/finding-outer-product-of-vectors-python-vs-julia.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Finding outer products of vectors - Python Vs Julia" /><published>2022-04-03T20:46:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-04-03T20:46:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/04/03/finding-outer-product-of-vectors-python-vs-julia</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/04/03/finding-outer-product-of-vectors-python-vs-julia.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And hello Ruby community!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to announce the release of I Love Ruby’s new front cover, and here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeicjk7vvjv7xivcz2m2cmfmxr5ioeuriedw2vm6wjyoawtiq6ls2dm.ipfs.dweb.link/i%20love%20ruby%20front%20cover%20final.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It features playing kids discovering Ruby and running towards it. I hope you like it. I wish I have all the time writing and refining my books, but life has other plans for me. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z34jYvHK27o&amp;amp;list=PLe1T0uBrDrfNyJ8u6V_3fdwtFdSWPpU7M&quot;&gt;My Ruby books video series&lt;/a&gt; has stalled too. It’s sad to say it, as my book is really innovative, I think I came up with the idea of naming things starting with &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; even before Apple did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I am working for a company who’s app is coded in Rails, but some of its front end is in React 🤮 (Matz is nice so I am not nice to even out this world). As I am tanking up my JavaScript knowledge and spending all my time learning it, I start to hate it more, at the same time my love for Ruby becomes brighter. Why can’t every one think like Matz and DHH? Matz (and other Japanese Ruby contributors), if you are reading this blog, watch lot of Rajinikanth movies and do something to kill JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you people like the cover, and please encourage me so that I have the will to proceed. Please do discourage and spot mistakes so that I can improve my book. I expect this from Ruby beginners. In short give me lot of feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One may contact me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:mindaslab@protonmail.com&quot;&gt;mindaslab@protonmail.com&lt;/a&gt; or signal me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.me/#p/+918428050777&quot;&gt;+91 8428050777&lt;/a&gt;. And yes you can get my Ruby book here &lt;a href=&quot;https://i-love-ruby.gitlab.io/&quot;&gt;https://i-love-ruby.gitlab.io/&lt;/a&gt;. I will update it soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my life I have seen dynastic politics in my nation rather than one based on ones capability or professionalism. I think in 1983 Indra was assassinated only for the nation to see Rajiv rise to power, he was killed and now we have Sonia and Rahul. That’s the pathetic state of India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to Tamilnadu where I live, we have a party called DMK and its been dominated by one family which was spawned by Karunanidhi. After his death we were all sure that the next DMK leader won’t be elected in democratic way based on his merits, but him Stalin was sworn in unopposed. This was despite the eldest son of Karuna named Alagiri calling for an election to determine the leader in DMK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call ourself a nation of democracy, we want our nation to progress fast, we want our children and grand children to have a better life, for that people who lead us should rise due to their merit, and not because they are the child of someone. Now in Tamilnadu we know that after Stalin, Udhayanidhi, that is Stalin’s son and grandson of Karuna will be come the chief minister. That sucks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy by the latest happenings in Delhi. 23 of tall congress leaders met and discussed, possibly they talked about a congress without the Gandhi family. I wish a congress with a strong non dynastic but merit based leadership emerges. If that happens they can take on the BJP which is drowning India with its blind faith in Hinduism. Plus a Congress without Gandhi’s will also make some people in DMK think of a DMK without the Karunanidhi family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nation needs merit based and not bloodline based leaders if it truly needs to progress. I would also blame the voters here. I don’t vote when I am confused, I just voted once in my life when I was clear. Many people I see caste their vote to some popular party because others cast their vote to that party too. If people don’t have a clear idea, I encourage them to stay away from voting. Else if we vote blind, it’s like a bus driver driving a packed bus blind folded.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Gandhi Dynasty</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Trapped in I.T</title><link href="/2022/02/18/trapped-in-it.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Trapped in I.T" /><published>2022-02-18T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-02-18T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/02/18/trapped-in-it</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/02/18/trapped-in-it.html">&lt;p&gt;I had to install some software on my computer to start off some projects, and i was thinking of doing it today, telling it to the person who I had to report, possibly get code access today and start seeing what I will be encountering in near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s DMK rule now and there was a power cut that started at 9:30 AM, and it’s 12:30 PM and no sign of power returning yet. I have always regarded Jayalalitha as the worst leader India had ever produced, but she solved massive powercuts in Tamilnadu, when Stalin took rule there are powercuts once again. As I type this I could hear “allah ho akbar” being sang in Mosque. A institution that cheats people saying that God exists has power, but me who work my ass off, bring foreign exchange to India, say with pride that I pay more tax this year than the last am experiencing powercut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the company I code for would think if I say I have pwercut? I don’t know. A boss could be one who could understand my problem, or he could be a psychopath like one of my previous boss . Even during height of covid, my previous boss wanted a full eight hour back up installed in my home despite old people old people living with me who could contract Corona from people who are installing the backup. I was happy that I ended the project with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I.T industry is like that, usually people who did not really code, or don’t want to code, lead people who could code. And due to their ignorance of coders problems they bring down the company. May be it’s complex, people who don’t code cannot understand the complexity we fae, and we who code cannot understand why they cannot understand us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually everything that’s been done by an I.T developer is subjected to criticism, by his peers, by his boss, by client and so on. This industry has evolved in that way, I don’t think it can ever be changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mismanagement is prevalent in I.T industry. We all know Alexander is a great war lord because he fought with his soldiers, but Czar Nicolas is not because he sat and slept on decorated furniture while his men died. None mourned the death of Czar. In I.T today it’s like that, we have got mere wasteful Cazar’s leading teams. Even if they happen to die today, none would mourn their demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people who I talk to want to come out and escape I.T, but for some reason we couldn’t. It seems to be a trap. We are seduced by money that comes when we type into our terminals from our couch and bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I.T people seem to be ignorant too. Tell an I.T guy to get a gas connection, to find a rental home, most of them will be at loss. Recently one of my friends purchased a home, he signed its documents without a proper lawyer consultation. I was baffled, but he is okay about it. It’s that much ignorant I.T people are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I talk to a Bengali or Keralite, they are full of knowledge, but these two states don’t lead in I.T any way. If I talk with a person in Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore, that too one who is in I.T, that person looks damn dumb, and it’s no wonder for me that I.T companies are run in very inefficient manner, people in it are very unhappy. I don’t see such unhappiness with a Bengali or a Keralite. Clearly we in i.T are stupid and missing something essential that a human must have. I don’t know what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May be it could be the smiles of another human. I take Data Science classes, people taking it express a feeling of gratitude, and I really feel like continuing it. I write books about emerging tech, people who read it write to me something good about it, and I feel like doing it. In I.T industry that’s not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeidlz2yqx2yabgvcz67o3mrnxnpvaoqqtrcxtzeto65xgt3dyjwxga.ipfs.dweb.link/Aloo Bonda_finalforweb1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Tea &amp;amp; Bonda&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In I.T you do one thing, and there will be ten mistakes spotted just because someone wants to prove he knows something, most of the mistakes spotted will be stupid. If I open a tea bonda shop, may be one in 10 customer will complain, that is 100X improvement in satisfying human. May be that’s what I must do. All one needs is a gas connection, and not electricity to open a tea bonda shop. Tamilnadu under Stalin will not have have electricity, but it definely can supply commercial gas cylinders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s this lack of humanness in I.T industry that’s killing it. To offset it, I.T companies hire bright minds with lot of salary to endure this shit. I think bright minds should find something better, rather than code for I.T. They must seek a place where humanness exists and boycott hell.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I had to install some software on my computer to start off some projects, and i was thinking of doing it today, telling it to the person who I had to report, possibly get code access today and start seeing what I will be encountering in near future.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Did Nehru go about inaugurating Temples?</title><link href="/2022/02/07/did-nehru-go-about-inaugurating-temples.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Did Nehru go about inaugurating Temples?" /><published>2022-02-07T09:50:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-02-07T09:50:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/02/07/did-nehru-go-about-inaugurating-temples</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/02/07/did-nehru-go-about-inaugurating-temples.html">&lt;table&gt;

    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Modi offering to Ramanujan statue&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modi recently inaugurated a statue of Saint Ramunajan,  Ramanujan is a well known Vaishnavite saint in south India. I am not worried what underwear Modi wears, or if he wears it or not, its his personal stuff, but if he exposes his personal stuff to India it looks ugly. Ones religion is personal stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wondered how the leaders of India (I don’t consider Modi as a leader), tried to open peoples minds. Take for instance Nehru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Jnehru.jpg/501px-Jnehru.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Jawaharlal Nehru&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I duckduckgoed about Nehru inaugurations, I found these pictures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeieyitmhrybyyv3efzmtudzzi2got4q6dlnyba7cjpfxtpwomebq4i.ipfs.dweb.link/nehru-opens-dam.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Nehru opens a dam&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above one is a picture of Nehru opening a dam, and the below one is Nehru with Vickram Sarabhai, the man who was instrumental in creating ISRO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeif5mkte2fkciwf47kxj4sufnmf3ykpcfzzmujo7a35eev6uu7m6wu.ipfs.dweb.link/131080-jcrgwwvakb-1605276168.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Nehru with Vickram Sarabhai&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nehru opened institutions and infrastructure that improved lives of people, that used Science &amp;amp; Technology to seek and find out mysteries of this universe or possibly multiverse. He was intelligent and never would want to fool people by associating with a particular religion. He made sure that he never promoted God, thus fooling people to think God exists. He might or might not have belived in God, but he made sure he never made a fool of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;congress-lost&quot;&gt;Congress Lost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress started as a religious party, it was they who pioneered bringing idol of lord Ganesh to roads. They knew religion is a powerful force. But then somehow something good happened, congress got bright minds and an air of secularism settled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then look at congress now, below you can see a picture of Manmohan and Sonia Gandhi paying respect to Saiababa’s dead body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeibrsbypjatdxfxzvpgszijjoutrgvevk55iqp25rcfgphb7wzkary.ipfs.dweb.link/del473378.webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Manmohan and Sonia Gandhi paying respect to Saiababa’s dead body&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did congress get lost? I am not sure. Where it’s intellectual’s went? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact Saibaba is a mere magician who used his tricks to deceive people that he had grace of God. If God really exists, why it would give grace to one or two and not all? May be God believers don’t have brains enough to think like that and hence most people will never think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the opposition is weak, and can’t hold up to it’s moral values, I wonder how they can question Modi?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;india-a-nation-of-science-or-just-a-hindu-pakistan&quot;&gt;India a nation of Science or just a Hindu Pakistan?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeige37urzsr7t5qkkdmkswwyodvyi6447sxgp5sad4hkcqmlesso3i.ipfs.dweb.link/obliterating-terrorism-in-pakistan-hinges-on-state-fulfilling-its-pledge-1454069531-1848.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Pakistan a nation destroyed by Islam&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is a religious nation that does not want to develop. We are Indian’s, we created our nation to be secular, its up to us to choose the right leader. Do we want our kids life’s to be better, and do we want Science, Knowledge, progress, this giving us happy and comfortable life? Or dow we want to be just another Hindu Pakistan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember Pakistan is a nation that is currently a burden to this planet and nothing else because they will never improve because of their religion. One must remember that Nepal and Bangladesh have shed their religions and have modernized.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Modi offering to Ramanujan statue</summary></entry></feed>
