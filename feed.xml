&lt;p&gt;Years ago, a farmer owned land along the Atlantic seacoast.
He constantly advertised for hired hands. Most people were reluctant to work on farms along the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They dreaded the awful storms that raged across the Atlantic, wreaking havoc on the buildings and crops. As the farmer interviewed applicants for the job, he received a steady stream of refusals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a short, thin man, well past middle age, approached the farmer. ‘Are you a good farm hand?’ the farmer asked him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Well, I can sleep when the wind blows,’ answered the little man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although puzzled by this answer, the farmer, desperate for help, hired him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The little man worked well around the farm, busy from dawn to dusk, and the farmer felt satisfied with the man’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one night the wind howled loudly in from offshore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jumping out of bed, the farmer grabbed a lantern and rushed next door to the hired hand’s sleeping quarters. He shook the little man and yelled, ‘Get up! A storm is coming!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tie things down before they blow away!’ The little man rolled over in bed and said firmly, ‘No sir. I told you, I can sleep when the wind blows.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enraged by the response, the farmer was tempted to fire him on the spot. Instead, he hurried outside to prepare for the storm. To his amazement, he discovered that all of the haystacks had been covered with tarpaulins. The cows were in the barn, the chickens were in the coops, and the doors were barred. The shutters were tightly secured. Everything was tied down. Nothing could blow away. The farmer then understood what his hired hand meant, so he returned to his bed to also sleep while the wind blew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re prepared, spiritually, mentally, and physically, you have nothing to fear. Can you sleep when the wind blows through your life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hired hand in the story was able to sleep because he had secured the farm against the storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above story goes on to talk about trials and tribulations in life and if we do our best to understand, accept, and implement the principles learnt by us we will experience a deep sense of security, peace, and joy from within.  We will then be able to ‘sleep when the wind blows.’&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The following story circulated on the Internet - a superb metaphorical exposition of the level of preparedness.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Don’t buy side dish from Yaa Mohaideen Perumbaakkam</title><link href="/2019/04/29/don-t-buy-side-dish-from-yaa-mohaideen-perumbaakkam.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Don't buy side dish from Yaa Mohaideen Perumbaakkam" /><published>2019-04-29T08:10:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-04-29T08:10:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/04/29/don-t-buy-side-dish-from-yaa-mohaideen-perumbaakkam</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/04/29/don-t-buy-side-dish-from-yaa-mohaideen-perumbaakkam.html">&lt;p&gt;Yestarday I was in Yaa Mahaideen in Perumbaakkam. We bought some khushka to eat and side dishes. One was Chicken 65 and other was Hydrabadi mutton gravy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The khushka arrived promptly, and later I found out that it was mutton khushka and not chicken, thats great, but at the hotel we were irritated to our limit. Once the khuska was given as parcel to us, the guy told us to go outside and show the bill and get the side dish parcel, so we went out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a small counter outside and there was all these Zomato and Uber guys. It was chaotic. Our token number was 70 and only token 29 was done with. We waited for 30 mins and our token wasn’t called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the bill and went inside and aked the billing guy to refund the side dish money and to my horror he would say he wouldn’t. What? They will make us wait, they won’t tell us any information about our order, we have to keep standing for so long and if we want to cancel our order they won’t do it. Is that a way to treat a customer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The billing guy said that our side dish was cooked and has been rushed to the counter just now. So we ran out to get it, the guy at the disposing counter said the billing guys knows nothing. We had to endue such pillar to post running. It took a great deal of protest from me and after nearly 1 hour they said they has lost our bill, took the copy we had and delivered our side dish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its not just me, as soon as I entered the restaurant, a customer was shouting at the waiter, he ordered a briyani, he was unable to eat it and hence wanted a lemon juice to go along with it. It never arrived. He shouted and and canceled it. The juice arrived 10 minutes later, that too when that guy had struggled and had almost finished with the briyani. He was really pissed off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deliver briyani Yaa Mohaideen is great, but for other things their cooking and delivery chain is broken. A Uber or Zomato guy there said he had been waiting for nearly 1 hour for side dish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I would suggest is to buy briyani there and order side dish from from places around it. There are other restaurants in the same block and they sell tandoori and other side dish stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally lets come to the taste. At home the khushka was okay, the hydrabadi mutton gravy was good, but the chicken 65 tasted like cardboard. It had almost no marination and was hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Yaa Mohaideen is like Apple, a brand who’s name is well established, highly priced and not really worth it. My suggestion is to try other small genuine briyani shops.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Yestarday I was in Yaa Mahaideen in Perumbaakkam.

We have lot and lot of terribly bad engineers. A lot of greed from families who want to become quickly rich from their kids has spoiled a generation, and the result, like a buildings built out of cardboard, we have extremely low quality engineers all around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market is market and it responded. Engineers today don’t get respect and they are treated like shit. Lot of people who never ever would have been interested in Science and Technology hold an engineering degree today. And they do menial jobs like data entry and get paid low, really low. I Think I saw it in reddit, a person has complained that an engineering graduate earns less than a pani poori vendor. True, very true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as price for an engineer drops, people are moving away from it, and that’s good. Because good engineers who are passionate about their jobs will stick with it, and people who hold engineering degrees and who are not passionate about it will leave. This is a very good correction. I welcome it with a huge smile.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Its good that people are turning away from Engineering.

&lt;p&gt;India is a democracy, which means one has got freedom of expression. One should have the right to express himself and herself in the form of text, voice, images, videos and action. And we should be okay and tolerant with it. We can ignore those expression, that’s our right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example I am an atheist living in a highly religious nation. I do get irritated and feel sorry when people worship God, and to put it mildly, God is not present. Yet we as a nation spend billions in the name of God every year, and still our policy makers have not banned this blind faith. Why? Because it interferes with the freedom of expression. Even we rationalist try to explain the stupidity of blind faith to the faithful than to lobby the government and seek a ban on God and religion. Because being a stupid is your right and expressing your stupidity is your right too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is the case with TikTok. one can use it for entertainment to cajole himself, or one can use it to waste away his life. One can use it to share a cooking tip or a scientific experiment, or one can use it to share porn. Its ones wish. Democracy should be tolerant and should not obstruct the flow of information and should not affect ones will and ability to express in any way possible. Its unfortunate that India is not a democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harassing China&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From being a Soviet colony, India has now become colony of the USA, so India must do something that pleases its ruler. USA is harassing China recently, like giving trouble to Huawei. USA is unable to control China diplomatically, neither China can be contained economically and it cannot be defeated militarily. Unlike India, its leaders can’t be bribed easily and hence harassment to submission could be one strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly European leaders will not obey the will of USA as they head sovereign nations,and hence USA has picked up India as one of its hit man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to use TikTok&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though you cannot download TikTok from Google app store, you can get its APK else where. Just visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://apkpure.com/tiktok/com.ss.android.ugc.trill&quot;&gt;https://apkpure.com/tiktok/com.ss.android.ugc.trill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

An engineer is basically a scientists who applies science to do a task, most probably to make people smile, or in some case to make people weep, like in the case of weapon design. No matter what ever an engineer does there is an ethic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are ethics even for a decoit; Ben Hall for example never killed a person even though he was a decoit. He never shot a police man who came to kill him in his final hours. Weather a engineer does good or bad they must have ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two ethics that were violated in Trumatics. the first, my friend Umashankar screamed at us, it was becoming evident to me that he was screaming because he was ignorant of what was going on. He wouldn’t take an effort to cure it. He wouldn’t trust us, or take in enough knowledge to cross verify what we were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the team, they seem to need spoon feeding and unlike adults they were quiet incapable of teaching themselves and finding things out. This made my life really difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treating people fair, and self-learning I feel are engineering ethics. That was not been followed in Trumatics. To make the matters worst Trumatics was nodding to absurd client requirements, possibly because of money shortage, and pressure was building up in a unnecessary way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company prior to Trumatics, named Zanec was a good one, but most people left that office because of one person called Varadarajan, aka Varda. For no reason he would make lives of of people miserable. He was a natural parasite, evolution has made him that way and there was no cure. Its like telling a cholera bacteria not to cause cholera, then it won’t be a cholera bacteria at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just need one person to ruin the company. I don’t know from where this evilness arises, but it does. Possibly only evil humans survived and thrived and they killed the good ones, so its part of our genes. May be nothing can be done about it.&lt;/p&gt;

I ask “why?”. We know the history of these parties. In this blog I am going to say why you should not vote for any of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;promoting-killers&quot;&gt;Promoting Killers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BJP kills cow eaters and non Hindus, Congress killed Sikhs. Both parties promote the accused Narendra Modi and Kamalnath to higher ranks. These parties that have such a large gatherings can’t even find a single person who is true and untainted? That’s amazing!! and shows to their lack of strictness and lack of commitment. When families in our nation weep for their lost ones due to communal violence, all these parities could do is to promote the tainted up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not talking about these people winning in court. Even if they have won in court, all the parties should have done is revoke their suspension and kept them as a basic worker and no more than that. Its strange that Narendra Modi and Kamalnath are irreplaceable. Its shows that these parties are unable to find a better talent in this vast India which shows their inefficiency. Should we vote for such inefficient parties?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dynastic-politics&quot;&gt;Dynastic politics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both BJP and Congress are dynastic according to Scroll.in, in BJP 31% of its MP’s come from some form of hereditary, and in congress its 33%. Just because we all recognize Gandhi’s we tend to assume Congress is dynastic and BJP is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again these parties are inefficient in selecting people to lead it. Rather than screening the nation and hand picking people who are truly interested in national welfare, these parties settle for the familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we citizens too settle for the familiar rather than screening candidates in our constituency, we will make our nation just another BJP and Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;same-source-of-funding&quot;&gt;Same source of funding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the BJP and congress, if they win will get funded by very same businesses, and they will enact laws that will benefit few oligarchic rich and will ignore us. So whats the difference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scams&quot;&gt;Scams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both parties are scandalous. Just because BJP ruled for only few 10+ years, their looting are less compared to around 70+ years of looting’s of congress. If we extrapolate BJP , they are nothing but congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;zero&quot;&gt;Zero&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/this_guy_gets_it.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Prinyka Herself admits it, and BJP didn’t deny it. The truth comes out some how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;elect-some-one-new&quot;&gt;Elect some one new&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In desperation to win votes, Rahul and Modi are coming up with lots of stuff, and they are funny. First lets look at Modi, the BJP tried to own counter strikes for Pulwama, they almost celebrated like they fed, brought up and trained Abinandhan. They created the Sardar statue, now I think its abandoned by its staff due to lack of pay. They are trying hard to bring back Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallaya back, even though these fugitives I think have contributed huge amounts to the BJP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Rahul drops a bombshell. He said families that receive less than Rs 6000/- per month will get a amount of Rs 6000 from government. Well, this is a impressive scheme, I am sure this idea never would have risen in brain dead Rahul’s mind, but rather in the mind of some intelligent guy in the Congress. But any way credit goes to Congress for thinking about this plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tough it looks impressive, we need to know how government is going to count the salary of a person who receives so less? These people operate by cash, you can’t really monitor them! How do we know that a congress worker cannot control accounts of a an entire very poor village thus he getting all this money and donating some parts of it to the party?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scheme is different than UBI. In UBI, theoretically all people receive a basic income. Lets say that your boss for some reason has turned sour on you, and your life under him has become hell, you want to quit, but what will you do for the next month? UBI might not offer you pay as high as your salary, but you know you have a basic pay to survive. Under UBI all citizens are equal, and all must get a basic pay and all subsidies must be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be happy if the Congress or any other party proposed the UBI of Rs 1000/- per Indian per month, and not some scheme targeting specific people for votes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ruby on Rails Developer needed in Chennai.</title><link href="/2019/02/27/ruby-on-rails-developer-needed-in-chennai.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ruby on Rails Developer needed in Chennai." /><published>2019-02-27T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-02-27T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/02/27/ruby-on-rails-developer-needed-in-chennai</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/02/27/ruby-on-rails-developer-needed-in-chennai.html">&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
