&lt;p&gt;In desperation to win votes, Rahul and Modi are coming up with lots of stuff, and they are funny. First lets look at Modi, the BJP tried to own counter strikes for Pulwama, they almost celebrated like they fed, brought up and trained Abinandhan. They created the Sardar statue, now I think its abandoned by its staff due to lack of pay. They are trying hard to bring back Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallaya back, even though these fugitives I think have contributed huge amounts to the BJP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Rahul drops a bombshell. He said families that receive less than Rs 6000/- per month will get a amount of Rs 6000 from government. Well, this is a impressive scheme, I am sure this idea never would have risen in brain dead Rahul’s mind, but rather in the mind of some intelligent guy in the Congress. But any way credit goes to Congress for thinking about this plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tough it looks impressive, we need to know how government is going to count the salary of a person who receives so less? These people operate by cash, you can’t really monitor them! How do we know that a congress worker cannot control accounts of a an entire very poor village thus he getting all this money and donating some parts of it to the party?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scheme is different than UBI. In UBI, theoretically all people receive a basic income. Lets say that your boss for some reason has turned sour on you, and your life under him has become hell, you want to quit, but what will you do for the next month? UBI might not offer you pay as high as your salary, but you know you have a basic pay to survive. Under UBI all citizens are equal, and all must get a basic pay and all subsidies must be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be happy if the Congress or any other party proposed the UBI of Rs 1000/- per Indian per month, and not some scheme targeting specific people for votes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ruby on Rails Developer needed in Chennai.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/02/27/ruby-on-rails-developer-needed-in-chennai.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ruby on Rails Developer needed in Chennai." /><published>2019-02-27T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-02-27T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/02/27/ruby-on-rails-developer-needed-in-chennai</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/02/27/ruby-on-rails-developer-needed-in-chennai.html">&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard stories about Trump, how much idiot he is. My friends say some of their American clients gets furious when name of Trump gets mentioned. Many in USA view it as a disgrace and depletion of intelligence to America for him to have got elected. Well, here in India we have been electing very stupid leaders in my state Tamilnadu. We Tamil’s are so idiot that we don’t even realize that we have been electing idiots for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any way this blog is about Trump. I was thrown back when Trump linked Socialism to lack of freedom in State of Union speech. Socialism has got nothing to do with lack of freedom or has got nothing to do with freedom. Socialism is nothing more than social living. Its like you teaching your kid share its lunch with a friend in class who has forgotten its lunch. Its that simple. You can see Socialism with mother who has lot of kids. A kid that faces challenge gets more attention, for example a new born child receives more attention than a kid that’s able to go to school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socialism can be forced or unforced. You helping your neighbor, or community is a unforced socialism, but say a class teacher forcing your kid to share its lunch with the one who has failed to bring it is a forced one. In a similar way capitalism can be forced and unforced. A free market is a free capitalism, but are we consulted before making economic laws, or are few business people consulted before a law in made in a capitalistic land? Aren’t the will of the super rich are forced upon us? Think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An economic model chosen by a community has got nothing to do with the sense of freedom. Sense of freedom is a relative term and its very hard to define. Its hilarious that a person who is controlling the most powerful nation on this planet cannot grasp it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Aadhar Mystery</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/02/03/the-aadhar-mystery.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Aadhar Mystery" /><published>2019-02-03T18:15:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-02-03T18:15:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/02/03/the-aadhar-mystery</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/02/03/the-aadhar-mystery.html">&lt;audio controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the recent 5 state election held recently the BJP lost, not by lot of votes, but it lost to the Congress. The Congress is building its image and is trying to project an image that its the nations savior from the Nazi Modi. Modi is a Nazi, no doubt about it, but Congress had it Nazi rulers too called Indra Gandhi and her son Rajiv Gandhi who tried to wipe out my Tamil race in Srilanka. Is Rahul Gandhi any different? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rahul-is-a-liar&quot;&gt;Rahul is a liar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rahul is certainly a liar. He lied to the nation about Rafel deal and called it a scam. The congress and team went to the supreme court and lost, yet they don’t want to admit their lies. Pathetic. Can we let such liars to rule the nation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;promotion-for-kamalnath&quot;&gt;Promotion for Kamalnath&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kamalnath is a C.M now, but when Indra Gandhi died its said that he killed lot of Sikhs. He escaped the law that’s a different thing. If a party is run by good blooded people, will a possible killer even be considered for a C.M post? On one hand Congress says Modi is evil because he killed Muslims in Gujrat, but Kamalnath is good because he killed Sikhs during Indra’s death. Where is the logic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dynastic-politics&quot;&gt;Dynastic Politics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its sicking to know that a 100 year old party cannot find its leaders outside a single family. And they say Congress is democratic. What a lie! These people have allied with DMK and S.P which are parties that follow dynastic politics too. if congress succeeds, we will soon see a nation ruled by few families. Is that what we want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-much-difference&quot;&gt;Not much difference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from not having Hindu fanaticism right now, congress is no better. Why vote for it?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>

&lt;p&gt;In the recent 5 state election held recently the BJP lost, not by lot of votes, but it lost to the Congress. The Congress is building its image and is trying to project an image that its the nations savior from the Nazi Modi. Modi is a Nazi, no doubt about it, but Congress had it Nazi rulers too called Indra Gandhi and her son Rajiv Gandhi who tried to wipe out my Tamil race in Srilanka. Is Rahul Gandhi any different? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rahul-is-a-liar&quot;&gt;Rahul is a liar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rahul is certainly a liar. He lied to the nation about Rafel deal and called it a scam. The congress and team went to the supreme court and lost, yet they don’t want to admit their lies. Pathetic. Can we let such liars to rule the nation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;promotion-for-kamalnath&quot;&gt;Promotion for Kamalnath&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kamalnath is a C.M now, but when Indra Gandhi died its said that he killed lot of Sikhs. He escaped the law that’s a different thing. If a party is run by good blooded people, will a possible killer even be considered for a C.M post? On one hand Congress says Modi is evil because he killed Muslims in Gujrat, but Kamalnath is good because he killed Sikhs during Indra’s death. Where is the logic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dynastic-politics&quot;&gt;Dynastic Politics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its sicking to know that a 100 year old party cannot find its leaders outside a single family. And they say Congress is democratic. What a lie! These people have allied with DMK and S.P which are parties that follow dynastic politics too. if congress succeeds, we will soon see a nation ruled by few families. Is that what we want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-much-difference&quot;&gt;Not much difference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from not having Hindu fanaticism right now, congress is no better. Why vote for it?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Will Engineering Colleges Survive?</title><link href="/2018/12/05/will-engineering-colleges-survive.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Will Engineering Colleges Survive?" /><published>2018-12-05T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-12-05T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2018/12/05/will-engineering-colleges-survive</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2018/12/05/will-engineering-colleges-survive.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuow/files/styles/x_large/public/201506/20150603-boeing-engineer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder weather Engineering colleges in Tamilnadu will survive for long, they are already falling and many have them have closed down or turned into arts and science colleges. The reason, well there are some which I wish to post here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-culture-of-looting&quot;&gt;The culture of looting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engineering colleges, almost all of them were created not to impart education to the masses, but in a hope of looting people and escaping from taxes by creating a trust. Many families in India do not know what Engineering is and they blindly put their kid into one. In fact many of the so called engineers in India do not know what engineering is. Take any person who has studied engineering and put him in a company, he will falter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Engineering college does is to sells you is a myth. A piece of paper that is worthless, but you buy it for Rs 4 Lakhs or so. With that myth which says you are a certified engineer, you come to the real world and find out that you are not one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact companies like mine employ these non engineers, give them money for free and give them real engineering tasks which the colleges have failed to do. And we find that the so called engineers are clueless and no idea how to complete them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prevention-of-foreign-universities-landing-on-india&quot;&gt;Prevention of foreign universities landing on India&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India has been intelligent to allow foreign investment in I.T, but we don’t see foreign universities teaching kids and making them better professionals. Kapil Sibal wanted to bring in foreign universities and offer competition to Indian ones, but these corrupted lot here bribed various channels and stopped it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without competition, our universities have stagnated and are teaching outdated stuff, their collaboration with Industry is almost nil, and even if we in Industry go on to help them, those so called engineers are so so substandard that they become liability to a company than an asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have missed an excellent opportunity of skill development because colleges and universities here have excellent bribing power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;comeback-of-foreign-universities&quot;&gt;Comeback of foreign universities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was interviewing for my friends company, I wasn’t interested in what college they studied or what marks they got, but I was interested what work they had done before applying. Students of Indian colleges have done nothing but to WhatsApp their friends, but students who have got degrees from edx, Coursera, Udacity etc seems to have done work and you know it from their talk. So a situation is now arising where though denied opportunity, foreign universities are coming to us via the internet and are increasing our educational quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a tech companies, we want people who can solve problems and work for us, rather than some one who says that “I own a piece of paper that says I am an Engineer”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-you-need-to-be-a-engineer&quot;&gt;Do you need to be a Engineer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe me, the work I do, if properly trained an 8th standard guy could do it. In today’s world you need not be a branded as rocket scientist to become a real one, there is so much on the internet that you can find out how to do stuff and train yourself quiet easily. Its a myth that you must be an engineer. Remember the first person who might have started an engineering college wouldn’t have been an engineering degree holder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We @ IT companies are not really looking at people who do have engineering degree, but we are looking at people who can do our tech tasks. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-cost&quot;&gt;The Cost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the cost. Should you need to pay Rs 4 Lakhs and invest 4 years to become an engineer if you can get a better degree with better training by investing just Rs 5000/- on an online degree and spending just 3 to 6 months? I hope you have common sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now small companies are failing to recognize engineers, soon even huge gorillas too will feel the pressure and do the same.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
