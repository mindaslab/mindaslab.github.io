     &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some times your peace and well being is affected by some idiot thinking some thing. Have you have ever had a bad day just because your bosses brain has got crooked? Well that’s the fate of India too, and possibly the fate of Europe. There was this guy Muhammed in Arabia who thought the then Arabic religion sucked, so he came up with Islam. If some one today claimed that one had seen God or Angels, you would be put in a mental hospital, but in those day they believed in him because he was a honest tradesman. Even very honest people’s brain gets screwed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now not being content with what he had, he said this Islam will spread to India, Rome etc. That is he just blabbered that Islam would spread to «all the countries that came up to his head», and that’s it, our fate was sealed. You see, Islam and all religions in this world are not religions of peace. We suspect Aryan’s invaded India, hence Hinduism cannot be considered a religion of peace. Buddhists masacare Tamils and Muslims in SriLanka and Burma. You have the crusades where Christians killed lot’s of Muslims. Similarly at that time Islam spread by war and conquest and not by people accepting it in a peaceful way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Islam was a peaceful religion, the original religion of Arabian’s would have peacefully coexisted with Islam, and today Kabba would have been worshiped not just by Muslims, but of the people of the old religion too. Islam just wiped them out, forced them to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its set in Muslims brains that one has to conquer to spread Islam, now since they believe in Muhammad’s blabbers, it means that Islam must conquer India too, otherwise the God man is not really God man! Its that’s why they try to conquer India so hard.Though many Muslim nations have given up turning India into a Islamic nation, Pakistan for its strategic interest still tries to do so. It control’s Afghanistan and since it has got one of the best and most successful intelligence service, the ISI, it does have the capability and the desire to control India. We have to be terribly careful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s an Islamic Caliphate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conquest of India by Islam is a part of the Islamic caliphate plan. Right after Muhammad’s death, Muslim’s were searching for a leader. They had the idea that there must be just one leader and under him the whole world should be ruled under the Kuran as its the book of God. So time and again some powerful Islamic ruler rises and tries to unite Muslims under him and tries to invade non Islamic territory to keep the dream of Muhammad alive. Till now they are bit successful. Islam now stretches from the gates of Russia to Indonesia. At the same time these leaders have failed too as they embraced violence and covert tactics to spread their religion, just like Muhammad has done during his life time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we must realize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no fucking God. We all know it. We take our kids to a doctor when its ill rather than taking it to a temple alone thus avoiding science. If God with such greatness exists, it wouldn’t have freaked out just because some one has disobeyed it and ate a fruit. It could have fixed the brain of the disobeyed, perhaps reversed time and made the thing of eating the forbidden fruit never had happened. If God is sooo dumb, my God what to do about it? Its worth killing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People should realize that God is just a feeling, an illusion in one’s mind. One must come out of this trap and must embrace reason and common sense. Else we will see more bloodshed in the name of religion of peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really a great move on Kashmir I feel, its really a great one what the Modi government has taken. I hate Modi and the BJP and the RSS for destroying India with Hinduism and with their stupidity in general, but the move was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kashmir is a part of India in every legal way. Pakistan with its misinformation and campaign tried to split Kashmir from India, and it tried to split Punjab from us. They failed. If you see, these states have the great rivers shared by India and Pakistan. Pakistan is terribly afraid about its water supply and don’t want these states been controlled by a power that it considers an enemy. Its a very natural feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right Timing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see things happened at the right time. Now Pakistan is disrespected even by Saudi Arabia, a major money source for Pakistani terror. None knows who controls Pakistan, if its the terrorists, the elected government or the military. Plus Pakistan is failing financially time to time. Even the Chinese who want to encircle India by making Pakistan one of their hit man seems to be giving up. Imagine China pumps investment into Pakistan and its gone without right reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silent China&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has its own Kashmir now, its called Hong Kong. China is trying to integrate Hong Kong into it and India is trying to integrate Kashmir into it. So China can’t speak a lot on this issue. The timing at which India executed this thing is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a huge Islamic problem for China too. China has relatively peaceful Muslim population in its West, think what will happen if ISI is able to radicalize them like they did to Kashmir, Punjab and Afghanistan and ask money from China for their reduced involvement? If China doesn’t realize it and stop supporting Pakistan, then its a huge problem. So rather than supporting Pak’s, its better for China to keep silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India must not loose vigil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Pakistan is weak, India must not loose vigil. A terror attack is very cheap. If you have a army, you must train people for years, they must have certain benefits, you must follow United Nations protocol and so on. For a terror attack, nothing needs to be followed. You can do it for few lakhs of rupees. Pakistan can do multiple attacks on India if India is not vigilant.
On a longer run these attacks would do nothing, but it might be enough to terrorize people and make them blame the government for taking a wrong move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must also look into funding of Islamic trusts, mosques in India, I suspect many could be receiving funding from ISI and other terror organization so that they can use them to brain wash people against India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have already let our territory to be used by LTTE and now by Islamic Tamil Terrorists to mount attacks on Srilanka, its a shame for India, technically India is terrorist state, no country has the guts now to call India a terror state, but that does not mean we are not one. We are a country who’s territory is been used to launch attacks on others. We are a terror state and we must curb it to get international respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economy in Doldrums&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No nation can be successful in stress and in war time if economy is down. Indian economy is down, our construction sector is gone, our automotive sector has slid, possibly irrecoverable now. SME’s are struggling and many are going down. If Modi hits at PAK and looses Indian economy, then he is a bloody fool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling he will prove himself a great bloody fool.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">வருங்காலம் நல்காலம்</title><link href="/2019/07/13/%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%99-%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%AE-%E0%AE%A8%E0%AE%B2-%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%AE.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="வருங்காலம் நல்காலம்" /><published>2019-07-13T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-07-13T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/07/13/%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%99%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%A8%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/07/13/%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%99-%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%AE-%E0%AE%A8%E0%AE%B2-%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%AE.html">&lt;p&gt;ஊக்கம் உழைப்பு நற்சிந்தனை தெள்ளறிவு&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its worrying, as a Tamilian its really worrying for me. Udayanidhi Stalin is taking the reigns of D.M.K youth wing. This was a party who’s chief Karunanidhi walked out a meeting when it was proposed Murasoli Maaran should be held up in high ranks, look now whats happening!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if the D.M.K people are safeguarding Tamil, just by knowing Tamil today I am unable to earn a comfortable living. The keyboard I type in has English alphabets rather than Tamil ones. Bus signs and numbers are written in English 1..2..3 than Tamil ones, no kid in Tamilnadu knows to do math with Tamil numerals. Even people of D.M.K are polyglot for survival. Kanimozhi’s school Sunshine is a English medium school than Tamil. Many Tamil families want their kids to have a English education than in Tamil. If Tamil disappears, I won’t be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing the D.M.K is doing well just like the Congress is to take care of its head family, that of Karunanidhi’s. That guy, his son and his grandson are politicians. Most of Karuna’s family are successful business people. If a Tamil wanted to have his own business, he must think a lot, he must budget, most probably he must give up that idea of having his own business and must choose to work. Even if he establishes a business, he has good chance of failing. Have you ever thought how the Karuna’s and even AIADMK families have established very successful businesses? Why their success rates are so high? Why we the people who they say they regard greater than their life have to fail and stress so much?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has a person in DMK ever thought why his son cannot become the party youth chief, but Stalin’s son can? Has AIADMK ever thought why there are many hereditary politicians in their party?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy about North India at least, Rahul is kind of no more and he quits, at least he is acting as though he does not have the power to run the congress any more. Politics and business, it must be run by people who have talent, not by some stupid just because he happens to be of some blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t feel India, Tamilnadu especially will have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Calling methods with &amp;amp; operator in Ruby</title><link href="/2019/07/02/calling-methods-with-operator-in-ruby.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Calling methods with &amp; operator in Ruby" /><published>2019-07-02T09:42:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-07-02T09:42:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/07/02/calling-methods-with-operator-in-ruby</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/07/02/calling-methods-with-operator-in-ruby.html">&lt;p&gt;Today I learned this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember when, it was a day when I bought Salem R.R Chicken Briyani and ate it, it was so good that even without my realization I ate it without any side dish. My respect for Salem R.R went through the roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next week I bought Briyani at the very same Salem R.R and I tried to eat, this time I was unable to swallow it without side dish. Compared to previous one this was crap. I am a regular buyer, and all subsequent weeks it was somewhere between crap and the good tasty one. Yesterday it came close to the good tasty one but was still far behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salem R.R is costly costs 200/- even for chicken. Though the quantity is little bit higher, it costs a bit high. For that cost they must give some justification in taste. One week its good and another its crap. I hope they hire process experts, apply some scientific management and make the taste consistent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Better Dask Than Spark</title><link href="/2019/06/25/better-dask-than-spark.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Better Dask Than Spark" /><published>2019-06-25T16:12:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-06-25T16:12:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/06/25/better-dask-than-spark</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/06/25/better-dask-than-spark.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dask.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to meddle with Data. I wanted to be a A.I guy when I was in college, but we were not allowed to take that elective, and A.I then was very different than its now. Back in 2004, 1 GB was considered a luxury, only very few carried laptops, desktops were computers then, and no iPhones then. People were having less devices that spied on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now things have changed thanks to the bullish push of Silicon foundries around the world. Price per compute has fallen like hell. Any one having right skill and slim wallet can have banks of computers working for him in minutes, we have Raspberry Pi thats so small and far powerful and far cheaper than the first computer I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;316&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CXCjpJasvG0?color=white&amp;amp;theme=light&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people who love computers, its like kid in candy store where the price of candy drops by the day. Wish I saw the same smartness and price drop in energy, health, education and food industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With computers becoming so cheap, and so much data available, what an A.I project would take months or a year, will possibly take a week or two to complete. Such has grown computer hardware and software that has run on it. Thanks to Free Software Foundation, most great softwares that are available today are affordable and do not have shackling licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for people like me, doing a A.I curiosity project is a monthly exercise than a dream. I use Python, Numpy and Scikit-learn for most of my stuff. Most of the A.I things are just looking at data, cleaning it and trying to fit it in a model and checking the accuracy of prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s get to the practical situation, we know that A.I algorithm spits out a better predicting model if it has more data to train it. So you have a toy data set in your office and you are confident the code you coded has a spit out a model that is good enough. Now your boss tells to scale, and there your smile disappears. You may be good at looking at data and making computers predict something out of it, but when it comes to scaling, nah, thats not your game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need Spark, right? I don’t think so. There is a new stuff called Dask &lt;a href=&quot;https://dask.org/&quot;&gt;https://dask.org/&lt;/a&gt; , I haven’t tried it yet, but reading this &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/spark.html&quot;&gt;https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/spark.html&lt;/a&gt; tells me its time to say goodbye to spark.
Rather than having a separate scaling up guy for your A.I project, Dask might let a Datascientist do it, and it seems to fit the normal data science workflow without adding much to the learning curve. So try it out if your project is getting bigger.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">One good thing I have done for my friends</title><link href="/2019/06/21/one-good-thing-i-have-done-for-my-friends.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="One good thing I have done for my friends" /><published>2019-06-21T13:25:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-06-21T13:25:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/06/21/one-good-thing-i-have-done-for-my-friends</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/06/21/one-good-thing-i-have-done-for-my-friends.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/chennai.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one good thing I have done for my friends in the past 2 years or more, that is to prevent many from buying a house in Chennai, and i am so proud to have saved them lot of money. Here is why you must not buy a house in Chennai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chennai is a dying city, having no water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, Chennai is a dying city. Not many people love Chennai, not many people in Chennai identify them as Chennaiites, they love their villages and towns and do not bother to maintain this city. This neglect has made lot of harm to Chennai, stray dogs, overflowing garbage, lack of good clean infra, and Chennai is always controlled by corrupt politicians and cops. This neglect and using Chennai as a money source has depleted it, now we don’t even have water here. To get back things to normal is going to take years and possibly decades. Till that time comes if you buy a home you will be spending any where between 5% - 25% of your earnings for just buying water. Is it good?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chennai has lot of water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact Chennai has lot of water. More rain rains here than that is needed by the people over here to use, but only 5% of it goes into the ground, which means 2 - 3 % only is put to real good use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of water capture can be seen every where in Chennai, even for moderate rains the roads will be flooded and traffic will be jammed. The government is waste and is comprised only of looters, but what about the people? Can’t they do something about it? No, never. Imagine how much of a fool the people need to be to elect such a foolish looters as our rulers. I never think Chennai people will have sufficient intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only if Chennai turns to dust, and some intelligent beings start to settle here that can really think, will this place prosper again. I feel its only a matter of time that Chennai becomes a dead city.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
