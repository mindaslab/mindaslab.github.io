&lt;p&gt;There seems to be some scam going on Linkedin which targets founders and investors in companies. This group seems to be tempting us with something. I received the above message which are very identical from two linked in accounts, one from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubham-ravindra-9360a91b7/&quot;&gt;Subham Ravindra&lt;/a&gt;, and another from a girl called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/papiya-d-3a25081b8/&quot;&gt;Papiya&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this happened Papiya’s account seems to have disappeared. I don’t respond to these messages anyway. This blog is just to warn my fellow founders.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">This man should be our Prime Minister</title><link href="/2022/11/23/this-man-should-be-our-prime-minister.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="This man should be our Prime Minister" /><published>2022-11-23T07:46:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-11-23T07:46:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/11/23/this-man-should-be-our-prime-minister</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/11/23/this-man-should-be-our-prime-minister.html">&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;

Biriyani there is cheap, I think it costs ₹110/-. It tastes moderate, the first time I bought the chicken was bit rubbery, possibly not cooked fully? I am not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the second time I bought kushka and chicken 65, it cost ₹170/-, there was a small piece in kushka which excited me, the chicken 65 was deep fried, came with few pieces of sliced onion and one eighth piece of lemon. It was more enjoyable than biriyani as this time there was no rubbery chicken, but that day I had a mild stomach upset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope Jai Biriyani improves. But I don’t think I will be buying from them again. The staff over there are all Tamil, so you won’t have language difficulty, they are respectful. I hope they improve quality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">When you take the petrol bunk left turn while you cross Sithalapakkam’s panchayat office, you will see Jai Biriyani.

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Elon Musk - The evil boss you must avoid.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I push for 16 hour work week, with four-hour work days. I strongly feel that knowledge workers should have life, should spend time with their family and loved ones, think and reflect, should get new ideas. This I feel will cultivate a healthy brain and will ultimately increase productivity of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Elon Musk doing in Twitter looks very evil to me. For some reason even people of science and creativity, when they move to management, they become task masters without brains. They seem to forget where true productivity lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are times when I finished coding for a sprint (2 weeks long one) in 2 hours, but yes all those other paper work does cost more time, but the core issue only takes two hours. There are times when even the sprint got over I haven’t started coding as the details were murky, or my understanding was not right. I understood a lot of things when I am away from keyboard, something works in your brains background while you enjoy life, all of a sudden most elegant solution pops up, and you implement it, and it works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow management people never seems to understand it, their view of knowledge work is like viewing a repetitive work in a factory. Humans are like automated robots to them. If a robot can drive 1000 bolts in an hour, then it must drive 4000 in four hours. In my view a human or biological system is not like that. We get tired, we get energized, we sometimes find work rewarding, and sometimes boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not worried about Twitters future, or its success or failure, I am long time user of Diaspora, I use Mastodon, and I have deleted my Facebook long ago. I am worried about the dangerous precedent Elon is setting in the I.T industry. With people like him, the industry will be populated by mindless ‘yes boss’ human bots who are there for a paycheck, than for the passion of coding.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Elon Musk - The evil boss you must avoid.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">This woman is such a great stupid, BJP people would love to have her in their party</title><link href="/2022/11/14/this-woman-is-such-a-great-stupid-bjp-people-would-love-to-have-her-in-their-party.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="This woman is such a great stupid, BJP people would love to have her in their party" /><published>2022-11-14T12:47:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-11-14T12:47:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/11/14/this-woman-is-such-a-great-stupid-bjp-people-would-love-to-have-her-in-their-party</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/11/14/this-woman-is-such-a-great-stupid-bjp-people-would-love-to-have-her-in-their-party.html">&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You turn left from the Sithalapakkam Panchayat office (the petrol bunk bend) and head towards Shankarapuram, you will see a hotel called Archana Bhavan. That hotel is not good for dining, it has got not fully closed space, you need to dine almost on platform. The ambience in front of the hotel is also not good. Dog and cow shit littered before the hotel and none bothers to keep it clean. I have seen dirty pigs grazing just meters away from the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no proper running water wash basin in the hotel, you will see a sink on the platform, near that a bucket containing dirty water with food particles floating in it and a tumbler near it, that’s the water they give you to wash hands. Once I went there to dine, and seeing this I returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is good however is their vadacurry if you get parcel of it, it costs ₹20/-. It’s nice oily and tasty. I have tried their idyappams with their vadacurry, it’s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Slack is a distraction</title><link href="/2022/11/01/slack-is-a-distraction.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Slack is a distraction" /><published>2022-11-01T19:08:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-11-01T19:08:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/11/01/slack-is-a-distraction</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/11/01/slack-is-a-distraction.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://logos-world.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slack-Logo-2019-present.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I had to do a ticket in office today, I started it and within two hours I finished it. This work was estimated for a week or more. I couldn’t believe what had happened. I submitted a  pull request, deployed code to our testing server and only in mid day I realized I had never turned on Slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Slack or any other messenger is turned on you are conscious about it. You expect someone to ping, this anticipation slows you down, drains some part of your cognition. When someone pings your attention moves, and rather than check the ping, you also check other channels and stuff. Then your brain stars to think in various pathways, your concentration is drawn out away from solving the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned on Slack, there was a pull request comment, though it was minor I think I took kind of 4 hours because I was looking at messages and interacting etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one has to be productive, I strongly recommend turning off Slack, Zulip, Rocket Chat, Telegram, WhatsApp or any other messenger, finish your task and then check distraction stuff in your slack time. But yes this does not work for all, many of you are paid to respond to distractions you get professionally, but for those who can be productive, be productive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Coimbatore blast, different perspectives</title><link href="/2022/10/29/coimbatore-blast-different-perspectives.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Coimbatore blast, different perspectives" /><published>2022-10-29T23:09:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-10-29T23:09:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/10/29/coimbatore-blast-different-perspectives</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/10/29/coimbatore-blast-different-perspectives.html">&lt;p&gt;Few days ago there was a blast in Coimbatore. The case has been moved to NIA for investigation. In this journal I document what I think different people feel about this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;muslims&quot;&gt;Muslims&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muslim’s are nervous. This is the second time that city is being attacked by Islamic terror. They do fear being demonized as there are lots of terror activities in the name of Islam in India. BJP is one step closer to demonizing them, just like Hitler demonized and exterminated Jews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muslims as people are harmless, but as far as I know, I think Quoran says that one day Rome and India will be ruled by Islam. So they are caught in trap. Islam doesn’t allow Muslims to question it, at the same time they do not have the power to convert entire India to Islam right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dmk&quot;&gt;DMK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Islamic attack on Coimbatore was by Ul Uma, when Karunanidhi was in power. I think DMK never got foothold of the city after that attack, now DMK seems to make inroads into Coimbatore and this happens.  DMK needs Muslim vote banks and is a coward party to take action against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DMK has always been soft on terror. Rajiv Gandhi was killed here in Tamil Nadu. A blast took place when L.K.Advani visited here. All wrong things happened in DMK rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at DMK’s move, I feel they gave the case to NIA because the state was coward to investigate and was afraid that it would offend Muslim vote bank. This is not how a leader or leadership behaves. Leader is a one that stands by truth all times. If NIA arrests Muslims, DMK could project is as an anti-Islamic move by the BJP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bjp&quot;&gt;BJP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no doubt that BJP is a Hindu terror group. They are destined to bring shame to all Hindu’s around the world just like the Taliban and ISIS brought and are bringing shame to all Muslims on this planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For BJP this blast is a good inroad for their effort to demonize Muslims, to put a perspective that Tamil Nadu is an unsafe place to live, and they are right, it looks Tamil Nadu is unsafe. BJP are already behaving like they are the opposition party, and they might want to rake up anti-Muslim sentiment to gain inroads here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;i&quot;&gt;I&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a rationalist I am thrilled. I have always advocated religion or any strong sentiment is a drug, and it makes you do crazy things. For me all religions must eliminated. Religion has costed lot to India, it has broken our country into 3 parts already and is doing damage every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a nationalist I am worried that ISIS is gaining foothold in Tamil Nadu, and all what DMK want’s to do is to loot for 5 years and go out of power, or bring Udhayanidhi to power if we are foolish enough. I also see that DMK is no longer a rationalist and atheistic party and has lost its meaning. All it wants to do is make few families rich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also see this attack on Tamil Nadu as a victory to Arabic nations. Stalin visited Arabia recently, are his Arab friends telling him to ignore terror activities in Tamil Nadu in return to make his family rich? I am not sure. Tamil Nadu is one of the farthest states from Arabia and Pakistan, and they are able to strike us here at their will and ease. India is a coward nation, unlike Israel, India would watch its people suffer under Pakistan and Arabs killing than take concrete action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I hope people will wake up to religious terrorism and will become Atheists, think rationally, and become peaceful while at the same time eliminating invaders.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Few days ago there was a blast in Coimbatore.
