&lt;p&gt;Its alarming how religious violence is increasing in Tamilnadu. Even during
partition of India, Tamilnadu experienced no Hindu and Muslim violence. We
people simply did not know the difference, but now it looks like we must rethink
things. There are people who want to polarize us so that they can come to power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today there was a news in Polimer channel in which Thanthi T.V news person asks
Tamilisai (chief of BJP in Tamilnadu) a question. Tamilisai complains about
the rising corruption in the state and how politicians have turned a blind to
people and how because of that 2 kids have died due to electrocution due to
watter logging because of rains. For that Mr. Jebersan ‘why is BJP so against a
movie Mersal, but its not showing that much intensity against corruption?’,
unable to answer Tamilisai becomes sentimental and flees the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then comes the drama. BJP cadres threaten and corner Jebersan, they question
him how can he ask such a question. What? Bloody hell, when will this BJP
realize they operate in India which is a democracy? And you should be able to
answer it. Is there room for dumb people like Tamilisai in India or do we want
a leader who can make us understand things well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By answering Jebersons question, BJP could have unearthed an weakness in it, and
could have proceed to fix it, instead they simply want to hide it from the
external world by threatening others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Renaming class in Ruby (a kinda)</title><link href="/2017/10/30/Renaming-class-in-Ruby-a-kinda.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Renaming class in Ruby (a kinda)" /><published>2017-10-30T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2017-10-30T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2017/10/30/Renaming-class-in-Ruby-a-kinda</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2017/10/30/Renaming-class-in-Ruby-a-kinda.html">&lt;p&gt;Lets say that you have a situation where you need to code about dogs. You know
that there are different kind of dogs and you end up with  a code structure as
shown&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-spacing: 0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot; style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Domestic&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;woof&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Wild&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;grrr&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are two kinds of dogs, one is wild that can be accessed like
&lt;code class=&quot;highlight language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Wild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and other one is
Domestic which could be accessed in similar way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you want to print out how Domestic and Wild dog sounds like you can
write a program as shown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-spacing: 0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot; style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require_relative&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;dog_in_animal_module.rb&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Domestic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Wild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you look I am using something like this &lt;code class=&quot;highlight language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Domestic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is
long to code and tax my fingers, what if I could do something that would make
my typing shorter? Fortunately you can do that in Ruby. See the program below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-spacing: 0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot; style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require_relative&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;dog_in_animal_module.rb&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;DomesticDog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Domestic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;WildDog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Wild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;DomesticDog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;WildDog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the code above, notice line 5 and line 6, we are kinda reaming the class.
Rather using the long form &lt;code class=&quot;highlight language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Domestic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
we simply assign it to a constant name &lt;code class=&quot;highlight language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;DomesticDog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;  as shown 
&lt;code class=&quot;highlight language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;DomesticDog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Domestic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and
in line  8 we can use it short like &lt;code class=&quot;highlight language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;DomesticDog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a large programming environment, we would have reduced lot of typing. Happy coding! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know that the Nehru family consists of a bunch of idiots. The fact how
Nehru was merciful with China even thought they were invading us in ‘62, the
fact how disillusioned that Indira Gandhi became and brought in emergency
rule, the fact how Rajiv Gandhi kept mum when Bofors was going on, the 
fact how he watched murder of Sikhs after his moms death, the fact how
Sonia and Rahul Gandhi watched the 2G scam when UPA was in power are proof
to their stupidity and shows inability of them being a leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps being stupid is in the genes of Nehrus, but there is another stupid on
the rise, this stupid once said that India was once great in biotechnology,
hence it was able to operate a boy, remove his head and put the head of an
elephant and called him Pillayaar. This great idiot is Narendra Modi. I think
he said this in IISC in front of scientists who must have got heart attack
after hearing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indians are so idiot that this guy enjoyed and still enjoys popularity wave in
India. Now once again in his speech his idiotness shines. I was shocked to hear
recently a speech where Modi was disowning GST. We all are now sure that GST
though a good idea was a failure in the way it was implemented. Just like
demonetization it was a good idea but waste in implementation. GST means tax
will become simpler. Many countries have a uniform tax, say you selling an Audi,
you charge 7% tax, say you are selling a pack of cigarettes, the tax is still 7%.
Though the GST has avoided multiple taxation (by state and center), the
implementers were stupid enough to have various tax categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temples and religious institutions have no tax at all I reckon even though they
cheat people saying that a thing called god exists, but alcohol which too messes
up with mind is taxed nearly 200%. Why? Because this is what will happen if
we are idiots enough to think these idiots are intelligent and vote them
into power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When GST was launched, Modi’s name was on it every where, many in BJP said
it was essential and great move. The idea of uniform tax is great, but the
implementation? And suddenly when there are state elections, GST rate changes.
Damn these fools. Confused, the accounting system in nation is in shambles and
none knows how to fix it. Its like Indian re-living the days of Muhammad Bin
Tuglak. Now seeing that things have gone worse, Modi is trying to distance
himself from the spoils of his governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this the way a true leader behaves? Shouldn’t a leader have the guts to come
out say ‘Yes I have made a mistake, I am sorry, and these are the ways I am
planning to fix it’. Isn’t that a mark of a good leader? Why on Earth Modi
who wants to project himself as a strong man is behaving like a rat and making
fool of himself?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mailsping is evil</title><link href="/2017/10/21/mailspring-is-evil.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mailsping is evil" /><published>2017-10-21T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2017-10-21T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2017/10/21/mailspring-is-evil</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2017/10/21/mailspring-is-evil.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://getmailspring.com/static/img/hero_graphic_linux@2x.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was using mailspring as my mail client for some time, but now I uninstalled it. Mailspring markets itself as a mail client for corporate and like corporates it has evil in its DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As digital freedom progresses, we think that one must not be tracked and ones privacy must be respected, but mailspring thinks the opposite. I was shocked to see when mailspring reported who had opened my mails and when. I called those persons and asked weather they knew that I knew that they had read my mails and they said no. This could mean just one thing, mailspring tracks people even without them knowing. Its evil, pure evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have been made to use mailspring because its convenient, in exchange it compromises their freedom. Thats kind of not acceptable. Instead I would ask people to contribute to mailpile which is hosted here &lt;a href=&quot;http://mailpile.is&quot;&gt;http://mailpile.is&lt;/a&gt; . Its not convenient to use, but its surely built with concept of freedom in mind. If enough people contribute, it could become the best Email solution. Or better one can use Thunderbird &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/&quot;&gt;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/&lt;/a&gt; with enigmail extension &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enigmail.net/index.php/en/&quot;&gt;https://www.enigmail.net/index.php/en/&lt;/a&gt; , these will prevent Google and other email providers from tracking you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Quiet proud of my Engineering training</title><link href="/2017/10/18/Quiet-proud-of-my-Engineering-training.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Quiet proud of my Engineering training" /><published>2017-10-18T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2017-10-18T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2017/10/18/Quiet-proud-of-my-Engineering-training</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2017/10/18/Quiet-proud-of-my-Engineering-training.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://b2aeaa58a57a200320db-8b65b95250e902c437b256b5abf3eac7.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/media_entries/5323/Indian_Engineer.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really quiet proud of my Engineering training, despite once again due to
enormous pressure from my client, people asked me to take shortcuts and I did
not budge. I wouldn’t say that I did not get sad, I was upset very much, but
I did not budge and do some nonsense to satisfy people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am proud because I trained myself as an Engineer. The college I studied which
is called Panimalar engineering did a worst job and I came out as totally
ignorant person. From that day on I trained myself in programming, assembling
different systems to create a product and most importantly technical and
engineering ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow any thing may happen, I might be accused of my bad attitude and fired from
project simply because I was honest with my client, or worst people could work
with me with a grudge against me, people may not trust me for a long time thats
for sure. The sad part is, some people who don’t trust me and fall to the feet
of client would be engineers too, thus upholding indignity that Indian engineers
have brought to their profession due to their ill training and inability to keep
pace with current progress, and there is a real chance that they would betray me
like Peter betraying Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am proud of myself of being unshakable and sticking to the truth, the
people who are supporting me in my defiant stand is my mom who is non
engineer! How ungrateful I have been to her till now and how much I understand
of how much she understands me now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What I hate about medium</title><link href="/2017/10/11/What-I-hate-about-medium.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What I hate about medium" /><published>2017-10-11T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2017-10-11T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2017/10/11/What-I-hate-about-medium</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2017/10/11/What-I-hate-about-medium.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://logok.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Medium-logo-2015-logotype.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium is popular blogging platform, but I moved away from  it to Jekyll and
Jekyll was good. Let me tell you why I don’t like to blog any more on medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medium wants to track you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium loves to track you. It wants to know what your interests are? What you
like to read? Who you follow? Are people working in Medium your friends to know
these details about you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though medium does not force you to login, look at this ugly tool bar at the
bottom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/messing_up_as_developer.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium reduces your reading area, it forces you to sign in to read so that it
knows about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don’t know what they do with your data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you really know what Medium does with your data and the behavioral data
they collect from you? Do they sell it to others? Share it to NSA? Who knows?
This is the major problem we face today using software as service platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anonymous commenting not possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even to comment on ones blog, one needs to login to medium and have a medium
account. Thats ridiculous. Commenting means you have more interest on that
particular topic, so you can be sold more ads about it. Thats why they want you
to login so that they can track about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog migration is hard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migrating your blog content away from Medium is hard. Unlike Wordpress you do
not have a good migration tool or a tool where you can download all your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens if you delete your blog?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In medium, none know what happens if you delete your blog or account.
Does it really get deleted? Your details are kept by them even if you have
deleted your account? Who knows what they are doing without your knowledge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these questions have made me to log off medium, I wish you too do the same.
Its far far better to have your own server, possibly a wordpress one and blog
with it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Electromagnetic Field Theory Book</title><link href="/2017/10/08/electromagnetic-field-theory-book.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Electromagnetic Field Theory Book" /><published>2017-10-08T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2017-10-08T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2017/10/08/electromagnetic-field-theory-book</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2017/10/08/electromagnetic-field-theory-book.html">&lt;p&gt;Get it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.calvin.edu/~pribeiro/courses/engr315/EMFT_Book.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Get it here.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why people use JIRA</title><link href="/2017/10/07/Why-people-use-JIRA.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why people use JIRA" /><published>2017-10-07T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2017-10-07T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2017/10/07/Why-people-use-JIRA</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2017/10/07/Why-people-use-JIRA.html">&lt;p&gt;Jira is a popular project management tool used by thousands of projects, but do
developers really like it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;how much jira do we have to use before we&amp;#39;re agile?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 0operator (@sadoperator) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sadoperator/status/916077741845258242?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 5, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they don’t, then why people use Jira? Well, Information Technology industry
is more about deception than real science and software, and Jira is much needed
by management folks for deceiving their client, so they use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jira has done lot of brand building&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Jira has done lot of brand building, it has made people to believe using
it will make things cool ad people have some how believe it. Some how none who
bat for Jira can publish a scientific study that Jira has improved their
efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jira is a jargon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of clients are ignorant, you tell them that you are using big data with
blockchain and everything is managed by Jira where he can know the status of
the project at his finger tip, then he would succumb to the jargon and think you
are great and you really know stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jira introduces inefficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clients and management like to see their team sweat out even if things are
really easy. Trust me, I am a programmer for 15 years and I have seen how people
make simple things complex and make you go mad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jira introduces inefficiency into project, it makes the project difficult to
manage and you need managers to do it. This creates fake jobs, plus having a
manager means the company can bill the client more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atlassian needs to survive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atlassian is one big corporate mess of fat ass bosses who needs to feed like
pigs, go on to Italian holidays, stay in star hotels and claim that they have
changed the world for good by introducing Jira, if you don’t use them
they have to make a living by cheating the world in another way. So please trust
and use Jira without questioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay happy living like a goat as ignorance is bliss.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Jira is a popular project management tool used by thousands of projects, but do developers really like it?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What can I do if computing prices are falling?</title><link href="/2017/10/02/What-can-I-do-if-computing-prices-are-falling.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What can I do if computing prices are falling?" /><published>2017-10-02T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2017-10-02T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2017/10/02/What-can-I-do-if-computing-prices-are-falling</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2017/10/02/What-can-I-do-if-computing-prices-are-falling.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Server-PNG.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we got a new client, he wanted to migrate from a previous service provider to
us. We have built a web agency thats cutting edge, we have developed automation
to such an extent that manual labor is reduced by 90%, and we are aggressively
pursuing Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend asked how much the infrastructure of the new client will cost, I said a
price that would baffle him, it was just 1/400th the price of the previous
service provider that had been milking our to be client. My friend flew on a rage,
‘you open source people just think about cost, there are other aspects there is service, value and
business angle’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I gave an another quote thats 12 time larger than the previous one and said
you can pay and buy beefy machines if you like, none stops you, but for this
project this look enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global server prices have fallen. We don’t rely on Amazon, Rackspace,
Heroku and stuff like that, we just simply use our own trusted server bank that
has enough replication to prevent data loss. To our surprise we found our offering
to be faster than Digital ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital Ocean is just a startup, which means that it barks and markets a lot
than it bites and does real stuff. Something is wrong with their server which
take lot of time to respond. And Amazon AWS is far worst, one would never know
why it stops or starts all of a sudden and why it lags more. Too much
virtualization I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are in the closed source, in the Microsoft camp can’t imagine if
something is darn cheap it can be good. They simply lack imagination. Possibly
they will value shit more higher than gold if some one can sells it to them at
greater price. And people who are in Microsoft, and Apple technological products
are doing just that, they are selling shit and are feeling good about it because
you have paid a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow free software people I see are able to look beyond the money and
corporate glare, possibly none is trying to make them dumb, or possibly they are
more democratic or something. They seem to have more common sense.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">India is not just two party state</title><link href="/2017/09/27/India-is-not-just-two-party-state.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="India is not just two party state" /><published>2017-09-27T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2017-09-27T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2017/09/27/India-is-not-just-two-party-state</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2017/09/27/India-is-not-just-two-party-state.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Flag_of_India.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my friends tweeted this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If not modi who else, Shall we bring back Manmohan?. I not seeing much difference between congress and BJP other than communal issue&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jahith Hussain (@jahith) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jahith/status/912988494632427521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 27, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was response to this tweet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Should Narendra Modi continue as Prime minister of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/India?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#India&lt;/a&gt;? | &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Politics?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Karthikeyan A K (@karthik_ak) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/karthik_ak/status/912956326598213633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 27, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked blunt to twitter users weather Narendramodi should continue as Indian P.M
or not? Its right for a person to vote, its right for a person to change his
choice of vote to any candidate or to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None_of_the_above&quot;&gt;NOTA&lt;/a&gt;
at any time I feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people think about instability. What will happen if one can vote again and
again, possibly multiple times a day? Won’t governments change just like that? Yes it
will. But isn’t a job of citizen of a democracy to be educated and not bring
instability in a nation? Or does a person think its the duty of the government to
force stability in a land that it rules? Which do you think is right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People seem to be having wrong notion, they feel people or nation can decide
better if we had limited choices. People feel like there must be a one major
ruling party and one minor ruling party, they must keep the nation stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I respect their thought. I respect them choosing not to have choice, but now
take the case of India, my nation. We have two major parties, one is Congress
which is ultra corrupt and another one is relatively less corrupt or good at
hiding corruption, its called as Bharathiya Janatha Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets say that I am a Biz tycoon dealing with billions of dollars a month. How
long it would take for me bribe leadership of these two parties? No matter who
comes to power, since I control the money I control the law, the flow of
information and hence citizens of my nation will think I am good guy all the time
unless a miracle happens. One or two might find out what I do, but its easy to
eliminate or silence them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets see how dynamic democracy works and how it will make politicians
tremble. In dynamic democracy any one can vote any time, or the voting time
period is reduced shortly, say 10 days (I wish it could be 10 minutes). You can
cast your vote once in every 10 days and it will be anonymous. Lets say that
10,000 people vote in a village, say if
there is more than 6000 votes registered in past 10 days, then the system will
count the votes, who ever has majority will be elected and dismissal order will
be sent to the person who was on power and if he had lost. Things will be
automated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic democracy requires two steps, two very independent thing. There will be
voting Kisoks all over the country. It will have two independent systems. The
first is an access system. It will take in your biometric and check if you
unlocked the system in past 10 days. If the system was not unlocked it will
order the voting software to take charge. The voting software doesn’t know who
you are, it will simply list the candidate and record a vote. Thats it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The access control software and the voting software shares no data. In fact the
voting can be recorded and shred in block chain to make it really transparent. Knowing
that one can be evaluated every 10 days will put shivers on politicians spine,
will make them obey to people quick rather than to dodge them in a hope that
they will forget it during the next voting season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-will-happen-because-of-dynamic-democracy&quot;&gt;What will happen because of Dynamic Democracy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic democracy is not just voting reform, it should also be the way one
stands for election. One should be able to stand as candidate in a place just by clicking
few buttons in an app. Why do you think one need to pay the sate or follow
formalities for one to be elected? That looks stupid to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So any person having the right idea should be able to become candidate,
challenge the incumbent in an instant. This way we will have richness, and not just people
sticking to two parties. We must not go by party politics, instead we must go 
by idea politics and elect
people who align with our ideas and are passionate about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see no different between parties and cults. I wish people who rule us be
independent thinkers and free souls.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
