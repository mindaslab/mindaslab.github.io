&lt;p&gt;“The “Universe 25” experiment is one of the most terrifying experiments in the history of science, which, through the behavior of a colony of mice, is an attempt by scientists to explain human societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of ​​”Universe 25” Came from the American scientist John Calhoun, who created an “ideal world” in which hundreds of mice would live and reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, Calhoun built the so-called “Paradise of Mice”, a specially designed space where rodents had Abundance of food and water, as well as a large living space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, he placed four pairs of mice that in a short time began to reproduce, resulting in their population growing rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after 315 days their reproduction began to decrease significantly. When the number of rodents reached 600, a hierarchy was formed between them and then the so-called “wretches” appeared. The larger rodents began to attack the group, with the result that many males begin to “collapse” psychologically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the females did not protect themselves and in turn became aggressive towards their young.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time went on, the females showed more and more aggressive behavior, isolation elements and lack of reproductive mood. There was a low birth rate and, at the same time, an increase in mortality in younger rodents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, a new class of male rodents appeared, the so-called “beautiful mice”. They refused to mate with the females or to “fight” for their space. All they cared about was food and sleep. At one point, “beautiful males” and “isolated females” made up the majority of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Calhoun, the death phase consisted of two stages: the “first death” and “second death.” The former was characterized by the loss of purpose in life beyond mere existence — no desire to mate, raise young or establish a role within society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time went on, juvenile mortality reached 100% and reproduction reached zero. Among the endangered mice, homosexuality was observed and, at the same time, cannibalism increased, despite the fact that there was plenty of food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years after the start of the experiment, the last baby of the colony was born. By 1973, he had killed the last mouse in the Universe 25. John Calhoun repeated the same experiment 25 more times, and each time the result was the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calhoun’s scientific work has been used as a model for interpreting social collapse, and his research serves as a focal point for the study of urban sociology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently witnessing direct parallels in today’s society… weak, feminized men with little to no skills and no protection instincts, and overly agitated and aggressive females with no maternal instincts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am shocked by Stalin’s announcement of massive 80 crore waste to decorate Karunadhi’s grave with a massive statue of a pen on an artificial island. 80 crores is massive money. It could be given to 800 people to start very small business, even if 1% of them succeed, it will be good. But what good does it do decorating a grave?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly wonder what gives right to these dravidian parties to put their dead bodies in Marina? It’s a beach, it belongs to people, more than us, it belongs to all nature. We have converted it into a graveyard and have put artificial structures there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A leader might be needed for a society (of people who cannot think well, for a society that could think will be leader less), but I wonder what’s the big thing in having a rotting corpse below a huge concrete structure? It looks childish and silly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the thing that outrages me is that we have mausoleum for a proven criminal Jayalaitha in Marina, and almost none opposes it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly think a person should be remembered for what he had done. Today I know English and interact with the world, thanks to Annadurai. I am an atheist and think rationally, and don’t encourage building temples, mosques, churches and mausoleum, thanks to Periyaar. I don’t remember these people because I saw their graves, but the good things that they have done to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember Abdul Kalaam not because of his grave, but he protected me from invaders, helped our nation become a space power. I don’t even know where his grave is, though I do know they have built one for him. I remember Kamaraj for his honesty and, his ability not to build grave for his mom even though he was a powerful chief minister of Tamilnadu. I don’t know where Kamaraj is burried, I don’t even know if he was cremated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst thing is that the 80 crores that Stalin wants to spend on decorating his dad’s grave is our hard-earned money. It’s not from Red Giant’s or G-squares or some binaami’s loot. I really wonder what gives the right for these DMK and ADMK to waste our money on dead bodies like this? May be if they earned honestly they would know worth of money and spend it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we people are powerless, coward, and have too much to lose now by protesting against dravidian rule, but I feel ultimately we must de-grave Marina. All these bodies should be taken out, put somewhere else, beach should be given back to people to walk, turtles to reproduce, crabs to crawl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage the reader to talk about this loot going on in Tamilnadu. I encourage one to think about the good ways of using money than wasting it on dead matter. I wish you would would remeber this blog when you vote again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Think like a farmer</title><link href="/2023/01/06/think-like-a-farmer.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Think like a farmer" /><published>2023-01-06T09:19:00+05:30</published><updated>2023-01-06T09:19:00+05:30</updated><id>/2023/01/06/think-like-a-farmer</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/01/06/think-like-a-farmer.html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuously improve.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

are 3 stages to acquiring knowledge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shu:&lt;/strong&gt; Learn the basics by following the teaching of one master. Imitating the work of great masters also falls in this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ha:&lt;/strong&gt; Start experimenting, learn from masters, and integrate the learning into the practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designers do cost, sometimes even more than developers. Designing is a very creative process. Certainly web pages designed by me sucks, compared to one done by designer. Sometimes I need to shell out a lot if I am doing my personal open source project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write a Personal Micro Blog application to learn Clojure which I named as pig. I have generated a &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeberg.org/pig&quot;&gt;codeberg project&lt;/a&gt; here. I wanted a cute baby pig as mascot. I asked designer and he gave me his budget, it was big. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/dall-e-2/&quot;&gt;Dall-E&lt;/a&gt; to generate the mascot. I used an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.upscale.media/&quot;&gt;A.I tool to upscale the image&lt;/a&gt;, and I used A.I to remove background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave the cute pig mascot to my designer to make it into a sticker which you can see in this blog above. I think I reduced designing cost by 70% this time, and I am very happy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Dall-E generated pig mascot.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">IQ of BJP vote bank</title><link href="/2022/12/10/iq-of-bjp-vote-bank.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="IQ of BJP vote bank" /><published>2022-12-10T16:20:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-12-10T16:20:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/12/10/iq-of-bjp-vote-bank</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/12/10/iq-of-bjp-vote-bank.html">&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I see a guy opposite to my home across the water logged empty ground feeding stray dogs. Frankly I would be very happy if he sees his children die before him and he one day vomits blood and die. He must be dead on the road, the same hungry dogs he fed must feast on his meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday gone, I had to concentrate on work, but from morning 4AM, a stray dog was barking right outside my home at the top of its voice, I couldn’t sleep. Thankfully my client is very liberal, so I tried to have breakfast, did some minor work, had some lunch and tried to catch sleep, then my neighbor’s dogs started to bark. I cursed my neighbor’s too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bloody stray dog disturbed my sleep again on Monday night and even on Tuesday I was unable to do the work. I don’t know where I missed out due to lack of concentration, but I was thinking Thursday wad Wednesday and I missed out on a meeting. I felt so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not against dogs, have them, feed them. But if they drop shit on road pick it up and take it home. Such an eyesore and disease spreading they are. You have to watch the dog shit or concentrate on traffic or pedestrian’s while traveling? Dog owners and lovers please answer this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you love dogs, have them in a sound-proof room where they can bark all the hell out, if you want to be in that room so that you can listen to the music you love that’s made by your dog, none objects, but letting it disturb your neighbor’s is barbaric and uncultured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafkreihkwj77nrjq7apxmiwkwqilnfnpjsiisgdnzs4ib623gvzu3na7si.ipfs.nftstorage.link/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not take dogs walks outside because it has no toilet sense, it shits out, and you won’t pick that treasure of yours up and take it to your home and lick it, instead you will leave it there. Your dog will urinate on lampposts and dustbins, and you won’t wash it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being such irresponsible human who just cares about you and your dog, what’s the use of your existence? Why you must have family and kids? If you have why should your kids survive with such a genetic defect you have? Why you shouldn’t watch your kids die thus feel bit better that the Earth is bit more purified? Why those indiscipline dogs you fed, feed on your carcass when you drop dead vomiting blood on street? Maybe some of those dogs might even urinate on your dead body proving their loyalty to you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What lack of sleep can do to you</title><link href="/2022/12/05/what-lack-of-sleep-can-do-to-you.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What lack of sleep can do to you" /><published>2022-12-05T17:14:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-12-05T17:14:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/12/05/what-lack-of-sleep-can-do-to-you</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/12/05/what-lack-of-sleep-can-do-to-you.html">&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;

I asked for a kothu parotta parcel and he said “kothu parotta”, the way he said it confirmed he was from north India. I wanted to ask what’s there in their hotel’s menu, so I asked it, and he said “kothu parotta”. I asked him what all items / dishes he had, he said “kothu parotta”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got fed up and started walking out of the hotel and said cancel it, he said “kothu parotta ready”, I walked out any way wondering how kothu parotta could be ready within two minutes. It’s annoying with these people now days, though I know Hindi, I am a Tamil and my Hindi did not kick in, these northern people have an illusion that everywhere in India Hindi is spoken, they come here uneducated and irritate us. It’s great that Tamilnadu is providing work for these people and is contributing to the uplifting of North India, but at the same time our government should ensure these people are educated to serve us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan is this, just like IELTS, we must have Tamil Professional Examination that every worker in Tamilnadu should take. Its syllabus should contain practical Tamil and must train people speak and write fluently. Imagine for example, how good it will be if doctors write medicine names in Tamil and medicine comes with Tamil labels in them? The syllabus should contain basic Tamil grammar and history, so that these workers who should take it by law to work in our land can speak fluently with us and serve us better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite dynastic politics and deep-rooted corruption that erode us, Tamils are hard workers, and we are developing. We are the most urbanized state in India, our economy too is diverse, we have plan to reach 1 trillion $ economy, and it’s high time we make our work force work smooth with us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Yesterday I went to hotel named Balaji Bhavan in Sithalapakkam, none except two were there in the hotel (excluding two customers who were sitting like zombies), some lady was doing some work and at the counter there was this guy. I asked for a kothu parotta parcel and he said “kothu parotta”, the way he said it confirmed he was from north India.
