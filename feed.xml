My team is in a
state where it does not know what HTTP 500 error is. That too one is 10 year
experienced developer and another is 4. I raised an alarm that we may not make
it this sprint, and why I get as a reward? It was told to me that I am been
projected as a great guy who will fix things up, a kind of guy who will not fail,
a kind of Rommel under Nazi’s and hence I must make things to work. I was told I
am granted all powers which means I can torture any one I want to get things done.
Thats far far away from who I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These type of expectations put me down. I know who and what I am more than anyone
else (may be Google knows more as it spies on me all time) and I know my
capabilities, I know my laziness and how an hurricane would not
move me when I am lazy. I know what I can do and what I cannot. And some one
places a blind expectation on me and that person controls my earnings I surely
don’t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its not just in profession, its in society. A engineering in mishap in my street
led to water stagnation. Some one had built an elevated barrier that obstructs
the flow of rain water to nearby pond. People in my street came up with an
idiotic idea for flood prevention, by elevating our road which would give us dry land but just would
push this problem further. When I pointed out we need a drain and not more barrier
I became a villain, but few people realized my logic and told me to run for elections!
Damn!!! I aint do this for power and popularity, I am just raising a problem
that my common sense put up to me. Thats it!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And not just society too, my family thinks I am a superman, some one who can do
my office work, attend family functions and a person like Gandhi who lives for
others than myself. Months ago my refusal to attend a family function led to
a torrent of blames and politics. People simply fail to grasp its not wise to
attend a function 100’s of kilometers away that too on an inconvenient time.
My request to attend function on another day at a good time that suits me was
rejected and I was villanized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly I don’t know what to do with these humans. They constantly need me to
boost up their image and wealth. They would trade my brand shamelessly for their gains. I
feel I am becoming more of a show piece, a piece of carbon been called a diamond
and sold for millions when I am just what I am. I am a man, who loves to live in peace
not any more, not any less.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I am consulting for a company now in Python web development.

It has given you the opportunity to succeed right?
And they make your life better and simple right? Okay in that case why don’t
your I.T company say that this is the Minimum Salary Paid (MSP) paid to you
rather than you are a Cost To The Company (CTC)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, why am I proposing this. Its simple. CTC is a degrading term. It means that 
you are costing that company, possibly not worth it. Well, that what it really means.
You are an liability rather than an asset. Customer brings in money and
magically it turns into profit, and you bite away those profits being an cost to
and rather not an asset to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies that truly care about people should not advertise that if you are
employed and it costs the company so much, saying that you cost a bite out of
their fortune, rather they must praise your worth. Companies must say that you
are worth so much, so this is the minimum salary that we can pay you. That means
at the end of working for that year your account will have that much amount
credited by the company. And that is a minimum amount. It can go up and not down.
This means that your minimum worth is so much and maximum is yet to be explored!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t that be nice?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Your company cares about you. It has given you the opportunity to succeed right?

for some reason panic set in. Rather than thinking of building a channel for

&lt;p&gt;Yes raising up the road level will prevent water from coming in, but till what

&lt;p&gt;To make matters worst, the water has no place to drain and it stagnates on a

was warned by the met department and the opposition to be prepared for rains,
let the city flood. We the Chennai citizens are unhappy about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Do you think Tamilnadu government was prepared for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChennaiRains2017?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#ChennaiRains2017&lt;/a&gt; ?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Karthikeyan A K (@karthik_ak) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/karthik_ak/status/926497890863681536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 3, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just conducted a poll on twitter and it wasn’t astonishing that most people
feel that the government wasn’t prepared for it. Whats astonishing for me was
22% felt that government was prepared for it! Thats a huge number infact. If
these are the people who are going to vote for AIADMK like fanatics, who knows
it would come to power once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another poll was about IT companies in Chennai. IT companies are worst managed
things. They are extremely inefficient piece of management, thats because we get
cheap labor in Chennai and hence they can be abused a lot. In fact slaves in
ancient Rome were able to work for just 6 hours and were able to get away and
they had 4 months of holiday! But we are forced to work so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the poll I conducted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Did your IT company in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/chennai?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#chennai&lt;/a&gt; made Saturday working because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChennaiRains2017?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#ChennaiRains2017&lt;/a&gt; ?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Karthikeyan A K (@karthik_ak) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/karthik_ak/status/926495453645901824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 3, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and not surprisingly looks like 50% of IT companies are inefficient and force
their employees to work on Saturday because of the rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is a food for thought, we the people of Chennai too pay taxes like
people in Tokyo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 4 stages in winning a battle against bad people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First they ignore you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then they laugh at you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then they fight you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then you win.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enter politics, especially in Tamilnadu and then to win will take a long time,
no matter who ever it is, Kamaraj, Annadurai, and other looters, they took lot
of time and mentoring and to establish themselves, but for Kamal it seems to be a
quick path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a rationalist and possibly an excellent thinker I guess, he is able to make
his moves quickly and hit opponents in the right spot. Signs are out that Hindu
extremist groups and political wing the BJP are starting to piss their pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently a person from some terror group in India has called for the execution of
Kamal and his fans just because he wrote an article saying that Hindu terror
is rising in this nation. I am really surprised, rather than ignoring and laughing
at Kamal they have gone to start a fight with him, this is exactly what a truthful
person wants, when wrong doers start to fight, it means one is closer to victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However history cannot be judged, anything could happen. Gandhi agreed to Pakistan,
after its creation he had plans to arose the conscience of people across both
sides and start a non violent struggle for unification, but then Hindu extremist
shot and killed him. The same thing could happen to Kamal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hindu’s, Aryans have no moral defense against Dravidians. Research
proves that Indus script closely matches Tamil than any other language. Possibly
we Dravidians are the true owners of Afganistan, Pakistan, and Infian main land,
and were slowly
pushed down to the peninsula till we became finally powerful and undefeatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aryans are awry of history and wanted to disagree with findings and wanted people
to believe
they own India 100% and its Hinduism is everything that India needs. This is as
stupid as Pakistan which says its Islam is all that it needs. Now look at
Pakistanis, look how they are? Till yesterday they were slave to United states,
now they are slave to China. Of course this that not vindicate India as it has
become 100% slave and colony of United States now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lets see, whats your opinion, try voting the poll I created. Who do you
support Kamal or the extremist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its alarming how religious violence is increasing in Tamilnadu. Even during
partition of India, Tamilnadu experienced no Hindu and Muslim violence. We
people simply did not know the difference, but now it looks like we must rethink
things. There are people who want to polarize us so that they can come to power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today there was a news in Polimer channel in which Thanthi T.V news person asks
Tamilisai (chief of BJP in Tamilnadu) a question. Tamilisai complains about
the rising corruption in the state and how politicians have turned a blind to
people and how because of that 2 kids have died due to electrocution due to
watter logging because of rains. For that Mr. Jebersan ‘why is BJP so against a
movie Mersal, but its not showing that much intensity against corruption?’,
unable to answer Tamilisai becomes sentimental and flees the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then comes the drama. BJP cadres threaten and corner Jebersan, they question
him how can he ask such a question. What? Bloody hell, when will this BJP
realize they operate in India which is a democracy? And you should be able to
answer it. Is there room for dumb people like Tamilisai in India or do we want
a leader who can make us understand things well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By answering Jebersons question, BJP could have unearthed an weakness in it, and
could have proceed to fix it, instead they simply want to hide it from the
external world by threatening others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Renaming class in Ruby (a kinda)</title><link href="/2017/10/30/Renaming-class-in-Ruby-a-kinda.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Renaming class in Ruby (a kinda)" /><published>2017-10-30T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2017-10-30T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2017/10/30/Renaming-class-in-Ruby-a-kinda</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2017/10/30/Renaming-class-in-Ruby-a-kinda.html">&lt;p&gt;Lets say that you have a situation where you need to code about dogs.

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Domestic&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;woof&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Wild&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;grrr&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are two kinds of dogs, one is wild that can be accessed like
&lt;code class=&quot;highlight language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Wild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and other one is
Domestic which could be accessed in similar way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you want to print out how Domestic and Wild dog sounds like you can
write a program as shown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-spacing: 0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot; style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require_relative&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;dog_in_animal_module.rb&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Domestic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Wild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you look I am using something like this &lt;code class=&quot;highlight language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Domestic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is
long to code and tax my fingers, what if I could do something that would make
my typing shorter? Fortunately you can do that in Ruby. See the program below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-spacing: 0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot; style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

9&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# renaming_class.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require_relative&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;dog_in_animal_module.rb&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;DomesticDog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Domestic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;WildDog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Wild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;DomesticDog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;WildDog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the code above, notice line 5 and line 6, we are kinda reaming the class.
Rather using the long form &lt;code class=&quot;highlight language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Domestic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
we simply assign it to a constant name &lt;code class=&quot;highlight language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;DomesticDog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;  as shown 
&lt;code class=&quot;highlight language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;DomesticDog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Domestic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and
in line  8 we can use it short like &lt;code class=&quot;highlight language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;DomesticDog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a large programming environment, we would have reduced lot of typing. Happy coding! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know that the Nehru family consists of a bunch of idiots. The fact how
Nehru was merciful with China even thought they were invading us in ‘62, the
fact how disillusioned that Indira Gandhi became and brought in emergency
rule, the fact how Rajiv Gandhi kept mum when Bofors was going on, the 
fact how he watched murder of Sikhs after his moms death, the fact how
Sonia and Rahul Gandhi watched the 2G scam when UPA was in power are proof
to their stupidity and shows inability of them being a leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps being stupid is in the genes of Nehrus, but there is another stupid on
the rise, this stupid once said that India was once great in biotechnology,
hence it was able to operate a boy, remove his head and put the head of an
elephant and called him Pillayaar. This great idiot is Narendra Modi. I think
he said this in IISC in front of scientists who must have got heart attack
after hearing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indians are so idiot that this guy enjoyed and still enjoys popularity wave in
India. Now once again in his speech his idiotness shines. I was shocked to hear
recently a speech where Modi was disowning GST. We all are now sure that GST
though a good idea was a failure in the way it was implemented. Just like
demonetization it was a good idea but waste in implementation. GST means tax
will become simpler. Many countries have a uniform tax, say you selling an Audi,
you charge 7% tax, say you are selling a pack of cigarettes, the tax is still 7%.
Though the GST has avoided multiple taxation (by state and center), the
implementers were stupid enough to have various tax categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temples and religious institutions have no tax at all I reckon even though they
cheat people saying that a thing called god exists, but alcohol which too messes
up with mind is taxed nearly 200%. Why? Because this is what will happen if
we are idiots enough to think these idiots are intelligent and vote them
into power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When GST was launched, Modi’s name was on it every where, many in BJP said
it was essential and great move. The idea of uniform tax is great, but the
implementation? And suddenly when there are state elections, GST rate changes.
Damn these fools. Confused, the accounting system in nation is in shambles and
none knows how to fix it. Its like Indian re-living the days of Muhammad Bin
Tuglak. Now seeing that things have gone worse, Modi is trying to distance
himself from the spoils of his governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this the way a true leader behaves? Shouldn’t a leader have the guts to come
out say ‘Yes I have made a mistake, I am sorry, and these are the ways I am
planning to fix it’. Isn’t that a mark of a good leader? Why on Earth Modi
who wants to project himself as a strong man is behaving like a rat and making
fool of himself?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mailspring is evil</title><link href="/2017/10/21/mailspring-is-evil.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mailspring is evil" /><published>2017-10-21T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2017-10-21T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2017/10/21/mailspring-is-evil</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2017/10/21/mailspring-is-evil.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://getmailspring.com/static/img/hero_graphic_linux@2x.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was using mailspring as my mail client for some time, but now I uninstalled it. Mailspring markets itself as a mail client for corporate and like corporates it has evil in its DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As digital freedom progresses, we think that one must not be tracked and ones privacy must be respected, but mailspring thinks the opposite. I was shocked to see when mailspring reported who had opened my mails and when. I called those persons and asked weather they knew that I knew that they had read my mails and they said no. This could mean just one thing, mailspring tracks people even without them knowing. Its evil, pure evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have been made to use mailspring because its convenient, in exchange it compromises their freedom. Thats kind of not acceptable. Instead I would ask people to contribute to mailpile which is hosted here &lt;a href=&quot;http://mailpile.is&quot;&gt;http://mailpile.is&lt;/a&gt; . Its not convenient to use, but its surely built with concept of freedom in mind. If enough people contribute, it could become the best Email solution. Or better one can use Thunderbird &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/&quot;&gt;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/&lt;/a&gt; with enigmail extension &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enigmail.net/index.php/en/&quot;&gt;https://www.enigmail.net/index.php/en/&lt;/a&gt; , these will prevent Google and other email providers from tracking you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
