    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Ma. Subramanian (DMK Minister)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was telling to my friends that sooner or later DMK ministers will start blaming AIAMK for Chennai floods and it happened. I switched on the T.V and in it was Ma. Subramanian. Exactly as I was saying he said the flooding in Chennai was caused by AIADMK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there is simple question, if you promised good life in manifesto, you must deliver it. Since ADMK ruled Tamilnadu before and hence never can Tamil’s have a good life even if DMK comes to power, then it must be specified in manifesto as well. Has DMK manifesto said that they can’t provide us with good life during rains because ADMK ruled before? If not why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.nakkheeran.in/cdn/farfuture/UjIHjGoUOsiaKB5XAhmXenLVd7HaTUE2CSqWZOHG5Bk/1544698206/sites/default/files/inline-images/senthil%20balaji%2055.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Senthil Balaji (Power Minister)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, this power minister Senthil Balaji who before blamed squirrels for power cuts. He said people should be careful with power infrastructure during rains. My simple question is why? Why should we be careful? If infrastructure in Tamilnadu is not good enough to transmit power safely during rains, then don’t transmit power. Say that’s the state of power infrastructure. Why put this rule and that rule upon people all of a sudden? Say that Varuna Bhagavan doesn’t like Tamilnadu to have electricity, and let’s go back to the age where we had wooden and cow dung fires for energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short why can’t DMK admit they are party who cannot give us good life if AIADMK ruled before them. That’s what they are saying indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Ma.

&lt;p&gt;I follow some journalists on twitter, and one of them from THE HINDU tweeted a lot about Jai Bhim, I think even before the movie launched he tweeted how good it was. I thought he and THE HINDU were bribed by the producers of this movie. There was a reson, I think years before THE HINDU wrote lot of articles praising TATA motors, and TATA motors ads would appear in the paper. I bought a TATA nano and it was worst to say the least. So I have always doubted THE HINDU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But any way since they were promoting the movie, I decided to watch hoping that it would be just another waste of time, but at least I can relax at that time and build more bad opinions about THE HINDU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy oh boy, I was absolutely wrong! Wrong wrong wrong! The story is about a layer named Chandru or something, this guy helped oppressed people like workers, kuravars and many many more to get their rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know that Tamilnadu police treats us very badly. In the theft takes place, a cop does not know how to solve it (I think he was aiding the thief), so he arrests a suspected kuruvan who was there in that house for catching snake earlier. That kuravan had never committed the crime, the police torture him to death and plays a dram that accused escaped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police were super cunning and planted false evidences and witnesses to make people believe these people really made out of the prison. It took the brilliant work of Chandru to bring things to light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;possibly-the-greatest-terrorist-organization&quot;&gt;Possibly the greatest terrorist organization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jai Bhim is brilliant movie, it exposes possibly the greatest terrorist organization that’s there in this nation. If a terrorist kills, he admits he killed some one, and may be if we want to hang that terrorist, he won’t be afraid to be a martyr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Tamilnadu Police is far far more cunning, they want to inflict terror upon people, yet they wish not to die or get hurt by it. It’s a coward way of living, but that’s how Tamilnadu police is says this movie. It’s a slap on their face. but the police won’t bothe, I’m sure, they are far far evil to be shaken by a movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt bad, I go around telling my fiends to install solar cells on their roofs, urge them to buy electric vehicles so that we import less oil. Our oil spending is used by Islamic nations to fund terrorist activities against us just because some guy called Muhammad, who at that time starved in caves and illusion-ed that he met God’s angels told that Islam would spread to India. So bad! So these idiots now want to convert entire India into an Islamic nation. It’s a stupid thought, but that’s what they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But greater than them we have a great terror organization amongst us which we cannot reform or be destroy or change in any way. That’s the movies point. I feel it’s a good thing to bring evil to light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look no further, we have this Thuthukudi massacre which Edapaadi Palanisamy (EPS) did, he hasn’t been hanged yet (this proves that there is no difference between ADMK and DMK, and they have some form of nexus), a terrorist murdered people for EPS so possibly he can et lot from Vendata.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Felix &amp;amp; Jayaraj. Father Son Duo who was murdered by Tamilnadu police for fun.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we have this Felix and Jayaraj who were murdered for fun by the police, and we all know those murderers will escape and we can do nothing about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disrespecting-the-true-indians&quot;&gt;Disrespecting the true Indians&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/165/352752649_01bd238ea9_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;A Kuravan selling beads necklace&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jai Bhim also tells about the Kuravar community. It’s possible they were in India even before Dravidian civilization took shape in Africa, and reached India via Mesopotamia and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8a/7c/40/8a7c40aae9ef6d5a4e225e8cb0af0494.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Valli the Kurathi, new wife of Muruga welcomed by his first wife Devaiyani&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were the guardians of the forrest, fortune tellers, they brought us the wealth of nature without destroying it. It’s said Lod Muruga fell in love with a Kurathi and married her. But look now how we treat them? Agriculture has destroyed our forrest, and industries are destroying our agriculture. The Kuravars are left helpless, our system has shut out the true people of our land in favor of invading Dravidians and Aryans. that’s very sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;movies-should-be-like-this&quot;&gt;Movies should be like this&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually Tamil movie is nothing but a love affair between hero and heroine, and before they can fuck each other, they have to do 4 dances, and the hero had to do 4 fights to impress the girl. That’s it. This movie is totally different. They want to make a movie this time and not a circus and call it a movie. That’s refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie looks so believable (though I believe the murderers were never hanged and managed to escape), and this is how movies should be. But I have no hopes for future Tamil movies, they just want to make money and will return back to cheap quality soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-must-watch&quot;&gt;You must watch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only if we know evils in our society, at least we will start taking about let, let alone destroying it. No Indian has the balls to challenge these evils. At least know what these evils are and pretend to act like a man.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">When Trix Image / Attachment does not upload to Amazon S3</title><link href="/web%20development/ruby%20on%20rails/trix/aws/s3/2021/11/01/when-trix-image-attachment-does-not-upload-to-amazon-s3.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="When Trix Image / Attachment does not upload to Amazon S3" /><published>2021-11-01T08:18:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-11-01T08:18:00+05:30</updated><id>/web%20development/ruby%20on%20rails/trix/aws/s3/2021/11/01/when-trix-image-attachment-does-not-upload-to-amazon-s3</id><content type="html" xml:base="/web%20development/ruby%20on%20rails/trix/aws/s3/2021/11/01/when-trix-image-attachment-does-not-upload-to-amazon-s3.html">&lt;p&gt;An app was all set and done and I had to test it, we had a commenting system and a rich text commenting was needed and hence we went for Trix editor which integrates well with Ruby on Rails. A problem arose, when we used local storage the image uploads worked, but when we used Amazon S3 it did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that Trix uploads images directly to storage, and let’s say if you are uploading from say &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:3000&quot;&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/a&gt;, you must whitelist it in Amzon S3 bucket. So we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So go to your S3 console, you will have a tab call &lt;strong&gt;Permission&lt;/strong&gt;,  click it and scroll down, and this thing called &lt;strong&gt;Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) would&lt;/strong&gt; appear&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/s3_cors.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the text below in it and save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[

&lt;p&gt;If you are using some other domain like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://abc.ocm&lt;/code&gt;, then it should be added instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I  was consulting for a company named Guidehouse in Trivandrum, Kerala. All was going good, none said anything bad about me or doubted my performance. Then there was a meeting all of a sudden, in it three of the people there, the H.R Shyam, Suresh Vasudev (Associate Director), and a person called Jeff who is some one senior in it tech ranking was there. They opened 4 page document saying that in my 9 months of work there, these were all the mistakes I did. When I questioned them they said I was behaving like a junior developer than a tech architect. I was shocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a mistake was found about me, why not tell it then so that I can correct it and be productive and contribute to the organization? Why wait for 6 or 7 months thus degrading the organizations productivity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tell the truth, most of the accusations in the document about me were false and bogus. They demanded me to do three projects in a month which was impossible to complete and some could not be stated because I do not have right access to systems, getting access would take weeks, I have to complete those tasks in 28 days. Clearly it was an impossible thing to do. I frankly told them if they want to fire me I was ready to go out and I have no regret, but they insisted this is not firing procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They gave me the tasks, I refused to do, and they forced me out of the company so it looked like I left. I was devastated and shocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My neighbor’s relative who himself an Keralite told me that that’s how Malyalis behave, they are full of politics he said. My point is your upbringing could be anything, but running a business, that too a tech company is near science and you have to be honest and practical to the hilt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why I am writing this now? Well, yesterday I saw in news that some one in Kerala had filed a petition against Tamilnadu government to limit the water level of Mullai Periyar dam to 132 feet, kinda 10 feet less than the maximum. This is done even though its established that the dam is safe in its full capacity. Its a pure case of a sadist who wants to bully Tamil’s. The sad thing is Kerala government supports that person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand you agree to some thing, and all of a sudden since you are a sadist
you make a U-turn and hurt others for unnecessary reason. It was very same for me too, they way they welcomed me to Guidehouse was great, I left other offers to go there, the way they insulted me and sent me out was very cheap, and I am proud not to work in Kerala any more. I would never work there unless for very compelling reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just me and state of Tamilnadu, but imagine how many companies, professionals and businesses in Kerala would have been harassed by people with such mentality. How many life’s would have been degraded, tossed to the bin without a reason just because a bunch of people who’s upbringing involves nurturing sadistic thought in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always wondered why Kerala has such a massive debt, why it was such underdeveloped that too when it borders Tamilnadu? I wonder why so many of its own people could not find work there and had to go abroad? Perhaps now I know why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May be Kerala till now is like this, I call upon the youth of Kerala to reform, come into the modern world, form agreement with other people and stick to the agreement and make yourself valuable asset than an doubtful object. You had come into this world with nothing, even if you loose everything being honest, or if you become rich by plundering others wealth by cheating, you will still die with nothing. The choice of life’s path is yours.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Using Bootstrap Icons in Ruby on Rails</title><link href="/programming/web%20development/ruby%20on%20rails/2021/10/18/using-bootstrap-icons-in-ruby-on-rails.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Using Bootstrap Icons in Ruby on Rails" /><published>2021-10-18T10:58:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-10-18T10:58:00+05:30</updated><id>/programming/web%20development/ruby%20on%20rails/2021/10/18/using-bootstrap-icons-in-ruby-on-rails</id><content type="html" xml:base="/programming/web%20development/ruby%20on%20rails/2021/10/18/using-bootstrap-icons-in-ruby-on-rails.html">&lt;p&gt;This seems to be the right way that bootstrap icons should be added to Ruby on Rails, I have tried many other ways, some work in local and fail in production, others work in normal production boxes but fail in Heroku, this one seems to work every where.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First you need to add bootstrap-icons to your project using yarn like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ yarn add bootstrap-icons
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next at the end of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss&lt;/code&gt; add this code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&quot;bootstrap-icons/font/bootstrap-icons&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@font-face&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&quot;bootstrap-icons&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;font-url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&quot;bootstrap-icons/font/fonts/bootstrap-icons.woff2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&quot;woff2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;font-url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&quot;bootstrap-icons/font/fonts/bootstrap-icons.woff&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&quot;woff&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can start using bootstrap icons like this now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-erb highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;This is the icon for pencil &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;bi bi-pencil&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yo could write a helper, in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app/helpers/bootstrap_icon_helper.rb&lt;/code&gt; add htis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;BootstrapIconHelper&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;icon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%Q{
      &amp;lt;i class=&quot;bi bi-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
    }&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in your application views, you can use icon like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-erb highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;This is the icon for pencil &lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;%=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;icon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;pencil&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are working under a psycho boss who says there must be brackets for Ruby method calls, you can code like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-erb highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;This is the icon for pencil &lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;%=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;icon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;pencil&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

When ever I pushed code for my startup (I hope it won’t become a fucked up), it said ‘common upgrade to Ruby 3.0.2’. Yes it should be done, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2021/07/07/ruby-3-0-2-released/&quot;&gt;there are some security fixes that you should not ignore&lt;/a&gt;, so do upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fired up my terminal and typed &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;asdf install ruby 3.0.2&lt;/code&gt;, for some suprising reason it said 3.0.2 does not exists, that is the formulas are not updated may be. I even thought of removing asdf and move to trusted RVM, but then digging documentation, I gave this command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ASDF_RUBY_BUILD_VERSION=master arch -x86_64  asdf install ruby 3.0.2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ASDF_RUBY_BUILD_VERSION=master&lt;/code&gt; tells that to pull from master branch of asdf ruby, so its kinda latest, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;arch -x86_64&lt;/code&gt; tells that we must compile it like X86 architecture and not for Mac M1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this it installed 3.0.2 like charm and I ported my project from 3.0.1 to 3.0.2 and pushed it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I was going through some of my personal projects, some were on Ruby 3.0.0, some were on Ruby 3.0.1.

&lt;p&gt;Let me tel you an example. Recently I took an I.T project, I was supposed to lead it, instead I crashed out of it. I was told to bring up Ruby on Rails software on my laptop, which I did partly, and to complete it I need to take dump of MySQL from server. None seems to know its password. The project manager assigned me tickets even before its done and kept asking me the status of tickets. I got annoyed, he then tried to arrange meeting with management. I was convinced he is a perfect manager, and there is no future for me in this project. He was just a messaging and annoying spam bot. I stopped responding to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project had no tests, it had no documentation, and none seemed to know what is what. This company was business driven, had no idea what right knowledge could do, had no will to empower its employees. Their idea was since I am experienced I will pick it up and generate them riches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was into another reverse e-commerce company before, one funded by Al-Gore, it had subcontracted some of its work to a company in Chennai, and it’s boss was a stupid. This company made lot of money, no doubt, but it made a unsustainable move where it made employees feel working hard and long means they are dedicated and great engineers. Kind of like 996 philosophy by Jack Ma. This company made work lot lot difficult, over here too finding knowledge was hard. I could take time, get the right knowledge and finish the work, but for the boss, if he knows something, then by default every one should know it, an hence work should be finished in half the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked hard, but my body took a toll and I had to quit. I am happy that I quit. Even today those employees talk very sad and depressed to me, wheras I have gone to create a new services company, and am creating my own productivity product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-need-kdd-pdd-and-hdd&quot;&gt;We need KDD, PDD and HDD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech work is knowledge work really. Many technical projects are there because its not focused on money, but its focuses on passion of people. GNU/Linux, Libre Office, Mastadon, VLC and so on, and they are successful. These are Passion and Happiness Driven Development, some are NDD (Need Driven Development). A for profit company too can have all these attributes. Here is how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-with-enough-money-or-will-and-time&quot;&gt;Start with enough money or will and time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start a company, you have to meet with lot of uncertainties, you have to have enough money and will to solve it. Trying to start on a dying budget and killing other people (at least mentally) because you do not have enough resources is not the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-not-have-project-managers&quot;&gt;Do not have project managers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do you need some one who does politics for a living? And that one just serves as a pipe, delivering messages from one place to another and not much else. Try to get passionate people. If a business proposal does not attract passionate people, then don’t take that business, better beg and survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;make-sure-knowledge-is-freely-available&quot;&gt;Make sure knowledge is freely available&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both the case studies / experiences I have told you above, my freedom of communication was restricted, I wasn’t allowed to talk to client freely. In reverse e-commerce company I have to kind of rehearse with my boss on what I would say to the client, if by mistake I told something, he (my boss) would be really pissed. He was like a big brother all the time. Knowledge wasn’t freely available and scientific progress does not work that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If can, invest in systems where employees will get right knowledge sooner, sit with newbies and coach them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;believe-money-will-follow-skill-and-knowledge&quot;&gt;Believe money will follow skill and knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happened for me! It will happen for you. Follow your passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kdd-vs-bdd&quot;&gt;KDD Vs BDD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current company I run is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://datamaking.com&quot;&gt;DataMaking&lt;/a&gt;, and we are investing in bringing up skills of people. We are boldly rejecting projects that doesn’t deserve to be a software project, and one that does not have a listening leadership. And till now not a single day hs goneby where I went to bed with regret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe in this growth curve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bdd_vs_kdd.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given same resources and opportunities, a company following BDD will grow fast initially and get profits, but it will plateau out as it will finally start to rely on management and marketing people to fuel growth, but look at the green curve where the company  invested in KDD, it will make a loss initially, but once it has caught it will over take the BDD curve, eventually it too would plateau out if it follows conventional business practices and falls to management guys, the tricks is not to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will that happen in DataMaking? Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Software Industry is a knowledge industry, it’s core value lies in its people, the knowledge stored in their brains, the intelligence they develop and willing work they put in, for some reason even veteran’s I see are creating companies that are business driven, of course business is a key to I.T industry, but the companies are mostly doing Business Driven Development (BDD), which pulls down the productivity out of the company decreases the efficiency of software industry as whole.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How the Universe could measure Time?</title><link href="/2021/10/07/how-the-universe-could-measure-time.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How the Universe could measure Time?" /><published>2021-10-07T14:57:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-10-07T14:57:00+05:30</updated><id>/2021/10/07/how-the-universe-could-measure-time</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2021/10/07/how-the-universe-could-measure-time.html">&lt;p&gt;I never got sleep for few days when I was studying 11th standard. I learned time is not same for every one. Time might be ticking slow for me because I am on massive Earth, traveling at incredible speeds through space, where’s an atom entering black hole could have much slow rate of tick, may be some where in void stationary space if there were people watching me on earth and the atom thats near black hole, they could be experiencing ticks much faster as their region is relatively mass less, and their clocks in their hand is stationary to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we kind of measure time depending on speed of light which we believe is of constant velocity, but velocity of light is based on time, so there is a circular dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog I would like to say how I think this universe keeps track of time. It could be right or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;time-is-memory-of-state-transitions&quot;&gt;Time is memory of state transitions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that there is universe, and nothing happens in it, then there is no flow of time. Now say all of a sudden universe switches from state S1 to S2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/time-created.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then if the state S2 and the universe remembers it was in state S1, then we register it as time has passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;short-time&quot;&gt;Short Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that there is registry of only few states (or state-transitions) available in this universe, then we say the universe is very young.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/short-time.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there another state transition takes place, and the memory of it persists,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/long-time.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then we say universe has got bit more older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;could-time-reverse&quot;&gt;Could Time reverse?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that the universe has gone from state S1 to S4 as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/time-reversal.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if there is possibility of universe going back from S4 to S3 by completely forgetting about S4, then we can say time has reversed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/time-reversal-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if that happens, there is no way of knowing it as there is no memory of S4 in S3, and hence no evidence of time reversal has taken place. May be there is time reversal is happening all the time (nice pun!), and we have no way of knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if time does reverse and universe gots to state S3, then it may or may not take the same path again. The universe may go from S3 to S4, or from S3 to S5 or may be to some other state as shown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/time-reversal-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-time-travel-may-not-be-possible&quot;&gt;Why Time travel may not be possible?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If universe reverses time we may never be aware of it because sate of the universe includes its memory. Let’s see a scenario as shown in the diagram below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/time-travel-impossibility.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Universe goes from state S1 to S4, then back to S1, in this case S1 knows that it came from S4, so this is the case of cyclic universe. May be as Sir Roger Penrose suggested universe could go to a state where its just another big bang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ypjZF6Pdrws?color=white&amp;amp;theme=light&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/iframe&gt;
     &lt;/figure&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once S1 remembers state of S4, may be that might affect the next state, may be it might not transition to S2 because of randomness, or if the universe is only deterministic, it will only go to S2 and no other state and so on to finally going to S4 and returning back to S1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a very deterministic cyclic universe, all that had happened will happen again and all that is going to happen would have happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-there-time&quot;&gt;Is there Time?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is just the memory of states of universe, that’s it. It’s the remembrance of these states we call time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;probabilities--birth-of-new-universe&quot;&gt;Probabilities &amp;amp; Birth of new Universe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to investigate if universe is in state S1, the is the universe is really deterministic? Or it has the chance to take on multiple states as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/new-universe.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If universe can slip into multiple states from current state, then is there is a probability associated with it? Can that probability be measured?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the universe is in state S1, and it slips into state S4 a special state where there is no memory of S1, then it would look like the birth of a new universe which arose from nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

I was unable to concentrate with all those noise. It’s local body elections here. DMK people were all at my place, my home received two rice bags, I think a total of 100 Kg of rice and a &lt;em&gt;thukku&lt;/em&gt; from mostly DMK politicians so that we would vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the other guys, brought in a sari’s and cash, people in my home refused it citing it was insulting, and just few feet away was the 100 Kg rice we received, but that rice and &lt;em&gt;thukku&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t insulting due to some way, may be because it was given by our friends! We have friends who are corrupt. Wonder what it says about us to this world? Any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how elections in Sithalapakkam is going to be: corrupt, and bribed. People might vote for the politician who bribed them the most. Even after the elections there will be stray dogs and cow shit on the roads, garbage will b overflowing, my street will not have a tar road, I am typing the blog under DMK imposed power cuts, looks like some one stole 2 Lakh tonnes of coal from our power plants and most likely the culprits won’t be found. Ya how will any culprit say that he is guilty? you need to have superior brain for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s the state of Sithalapakkam elections. India is long dead, now people with our skin color have taken our freedom and good life away, and we don’t know how to destroy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one way however my friends, receive all that you get from the politicians and vote for a person who hasn’t bribed you. May be he is good.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Speakers were blaring till yesterday in my road 3rd street, Skylab Avenue, wooing us to vote, it was bloody annoying.
