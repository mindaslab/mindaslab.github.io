&lt;p&gt;So I had to do a ticket in office today, I started it and within two hours I finished it. This work was estimated for a week or more. I couldn’t believe what had happened. I submitted a  pull request, deployed code to our testing server and only in mid day I realized I had never turned on Slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Slack or any other messenger is turned on you are conscious about it. You expect someone to ping, this anticipation slows you down, drains some part of your cognition. When someone pings your attention moves, and rather than check the ping, you also check other channels and stuff. Then your brain stars to think in various pathways, your concentration is drawn out away from solving the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned on Slack, there was a pull request comment, though it was minor I think I took kind of 4 hours because I was looking at messages and interacting etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one has to be productive, I strongly recommend turning off Slack, Zulip, Rocket Chat, Telegram, WhatsApp or any other messenger, finish your task and then check distraction stuff in your slack time. But yes this does not work for all, many of you are paid to respond to distractions you get professionally, but for those who can be productive, be productive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Coimbatore blast, different perspectives</title><link href="/2022/10/29/coimbatore-blast-different-perspectives.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Coimbatore blast, different perspectives" /><published>2022-10-29T23:09:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-10-29T23:09:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/10/29/coimbatore-blast-different-perspectives</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/10/29/coimbatore-blast-different-perspectives.html">&lt;p&gt;Few days ago there was a blast in Coimbatore. The case has been moved to NIA for investigation. In this journal I document what I think different people feel about this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;muslims&quot;&gt;Muslims&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muslim’s are nervous. This is the second time that city is being attacked by Islamic terror. They do fear being demonized as there are lots of terror activities in the name of Islam in India. BJP is one step closer to demonizing them, just like Hitler demonized and exterminated Jews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muslims as people are harmless, but as far as I know, I think Quoran says that one day Rome and India will be ruled by Islam. So they are caught in trap. Islam doesn’t allow Muslims to question it, at the same time they do not have the power to convert entire India to Islam right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dmk&quot;&gt;DMK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Islamic attack on Coimbatore was by Ul Uma, when Karunanidhi was in power. I think DMK never got foothold of the city after that attack, now DMK seems to make inroads into Coimbatore and this happens.  DMK needs Muslim vote banks and is a coward party to take action against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DMK has always been soft on terror. Rajiv Gandhi was killed here in Tamil Nadu. A blast took place when L.K.Advani visited here. All wrong things happened in DMK rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at DMK’s move, I feel they gave the case to NIA because the state was coward to investigate and was afraid that it would offend Muslim vote bank. This is not how a leader or leadership behaves. Leader is a one that stands by truth all times. If NIA arrests Muslims, DMK could project is as an anti-Islamic move by the BJP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bjp&quot;&gt;BJP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no doubt that BJP is a Hindu terror group. They are destined to bring shame to all Hindu’s around the world just like the Taliban and ISIS brought and are bringing shame to all Muslims on this planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For BJP this blast is a good inroad for their effort to demonize Muslims, to put a perspective that Tamil Nadu is an unsafe place to live, and they are right, it looks Tamil Nadu is unsafe. BJP are already behaving like they are the opposition party, and they might want to rake up anti-Muslim sentiment to gain inroads here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;i&quot;&gt;I&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a rationalist I am thrilled. I have always advocated religion or any strong sentiment is a drug, and it makes you do crazy things. For me all religions must eliminated. Religion has costed lot to India, it has broken our country into 3 parts already and is doing damage every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a nationalist I am worried that ISIS is gaining foothold in Tamil Nadu, and all what DMK want’s to do is to loot for 5 years and go out of power, or bring Udhayanidhi to power if we are foolish enough. I also see that DMK is no longer a rationalist and atheistic party and has lost its meaning. All it wants to do is make few families rich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also see this attack on Tamil Nadu as a victory to Arabic nations. Stalin visited Arabia recently, are his Arab friends telling him to ignore terror activities in Tamil Nadu in return to make his family rich? I am not sure. Tamil Nadu is one of the farthest states from Arabia and Pakistan, and they are able to strike us here at their will and ease. India is a coward nation, unlike Israel, India would watch its people suffer under Pakistan and Arabs killing than take concrete action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I hope people will wake up to religious terrorism and will become Atheists, think rationally, and become peaceful while at the same time eliminating invaders.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Few days ago there was a blast in Coimbatore.

&lt;p&gt;I was and am still really confused by gold. Why do people buy it? It’s literally a useless metal unless you want to create an inert surface or if you want to wire circuits. Just like Lenin said, gold is good for building toilets, or it may not even be good for that as silver is more bacterial resistant than gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my friend still lives in village and makes trips to Chennai every year, and gold is his purchase too. I asked him why he buys it regularly, and what he said baffled me. He said women think gold is beautiful. What? I couldn’t believe it. It’s such a negative investment, and people do it just because someone feels it’s beautiful? It defied all my senses, but he held to his point. He didn’t claim what he said was logical, but his claim was he is okay with the continuation of peace in his family despite the high financial burden that he had to endure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really felt sorry for him. For a person who thinks, I just have a question. There are plenty of ways to create more money from money. Let’s say you buy pure 24-carat gold, can you trade it the next year and buy even more gold? Think people think. Life is not about amassing stuff you want like crazy till you die. I feel life is, say if you have 200 hours of free time the last year, you must have at least 220 hours of quality free time this year. It should compound at the rate of 10 percent till one day you are so much financially interdependent that there is no need to work. You may work, but you do it because you want to, but not because you have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not achieving that goal, I truly feel one is a fool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arguing-from-the-point-of-science&quot;&gt;Arguing from the point of science&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once people felt insulted in Napoleon’s dining table when their cutlery was not made with most expensive metal of that time. Today we call that metal Aluminum. Today it’s used to make utensils for prisoners because it’s so cheap. Gold is like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We humans at the max only mined down to a kilometer under the Earth. Gold is denser, as our tech improves, robots can go further down and bring us more gold. We will park asteroids in our orbit which contains more gold than mined ever by humanity. Engineered bacteria and nanobots will concentrate out gold from seawater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s only a matter of decades or at max a century that gold becomes plentiful and worthless.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Don’t buy AGARO Regal Plus Upright Vacuum Cleaner</title><link href="/2022/09/05/don-t-buy-agaro-regal-plus-upright-vacuum-cleaner.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Don&apos;t buy AGARO Regal Plus Upright Vacuum Cleaner" /><published>2022-09-05T15:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-09-05T15:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/09/05/don-t-buy-agaro-regal-plus-upright-vacuum-cleaner</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/09/05/don-t-buy-agaro-regal-plus-upright-vacuum-cleaner.html">&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a professional coder. I think after long time I have found a right place to work. I feel like I am in a team manged by a person who knows to code, who had coded in the past and may be codes even today. I feel like I work under a person who understands programmers brain, and protects us. Yet sometimes I feel like I open up a tea and bonda shop and quit coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern software is a complex system. We use Ruby in which we can accomplish a lot with few lines code, say compared to say C++ or Java, yet the systems I code have tens and thousands of lines. These days we believe that if we name our functions and variables right we can avoid comments altogether, and we still have a system where we need to deliver code in fixed time. These things though seen separately looks very innocent, but when combined breaks things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I had to code a feature, I was trying to read code and understand it, I was looking at deadline and I understood and gave a pull request, and I was confident. Turns out my understanding was wrong. Though variables were named and functions were named in a good way, when trying to read it in a given time it did not convey the entire information. I tapped into a API, but I should have tapped into deeper and low level API’s. I understood all these after a call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might ask why not discuss with others before coding a thing. It’s like this we coders do not disturb others unnecessarily. Thinking is costly and drains energy. If thought is disturbed, it takes time to bring it back in, it takes time to match it with trail of code you were following. So we don’t disturb others, and in that process we don’t want our trail of thought to be disturbed too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is unique when you take up a new issue in programming, it’s like you are writing new poetry, or imagining a new picture to draw every time. That too you are doing it to match the thought of your customer, who apparently places time restriction to finish it. Errors do happen. Fortunately the place where I work, its seems to be tolerated more, but believe me, compared to this place, I have worked in places enriched with politics, corporatism, and places filled with people who do not know a thing about coding and control us. Its hell compared to my present client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when deadline slips, no matter how tolerant your client is or not, it hurts. It’s then when I think of having a tea and bonda shop somewhere. The recipe for tea, bonda, samosa doesn’t change. Rather than a dozen comments for one pull request, maybe you will have one guy in a hundred complaining about your tea, bonda, samosa or vadai. If I own the shop, I am legally answerable to none. But ya I live in Tamilnadu, India where rowdies can rampage my shop, police could ask bribes and I won’t be able to say ‘no’, and must go to bed with some guilt after paying bribes. But at least every situation is not new, unique, that should be studied and understood and should be derived on tine estimate that none seems to get right in the history of programming.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How backward Hindu’s are?</title><link href="/2022/08/31/how-backward-hindu-s-are.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How backward Hindu&apos;s are?" /><published>2022-08-31T22:21:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-08-31T22:21:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/08/31/how-backward-hindu-s-are</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/08/31/how-backward-hindu-s-are.html">&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We in India make fun of Pakistan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar. These regions take religion as truth and prefer to stay backward for generations to come. If you are one such person and living in Tamilnadu and thinking Tamilnadu is a progressive state, watch the video above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are gangs in Tamilnadu that take ancient Hindu verses as truth and want to take us backwards. They have a huge following. The followings are so foolish that they believe in God, miracle, supernatural forces etc. These followings think that God is better worshipped not in Tamil, or ones mother tongue, but they believe God is better worshipped with an extinct language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These groups believe in caste, religion, and segregation of people. In short, they are threat to nation that emphasizes equality of all humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Your browser does not support the video element.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A to Z Pyramid in Ruby</title><link href="/2022/08/26/a-to-z-pyramid-in-ruby.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A to Z Pyramid in Ruby" /><published>2022-08-26T22:22:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-08-26T22:22:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/08/26/a-to-z-pyramid-in-ruby</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/08/26/a-to-z-pyramid-in-ruby.html">&lt;p&gt;I was contacted by some one on the Internet to print a pyramid from A to Z which has the following pattern:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s Tamilnadu’s finance minister P.T.R.Palanivel Thiyagarajan demolishing the BJP and Modi’s economics. The BJP has no response to it other than mud slinging or diversionary talk, hiring people to throw slippers at P.T.R as protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BJP is old school, telling people to read Sanksrit, and old Hindu text and promising a miracle will come out of it. P.T.R is a man of data, he uses statistics to justify himself. Rather than we Indians seeing this as a war between P.T.R and BJP, we must see it as a war between statistician / economist with data and people of blind faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way the BJP to come out of this mess is to drop this individual Modi worship stuff, they must drop this Hindutva stuff, and truly become Bharitya Janatha Party, a party that really strives in a scientific way, backed by data and experiments to improve the life of people. Right now they are too stupid to reform. It’s we people who must vote out Modi and bring in intelligent people to power for our nation to prosper.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Imagine the Taliban talking about good governance.

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got fed up, I wanted to create a 2 folders inside a folder, and a file inside one of the subfolder. I searched and could not get a GNU/Linux command for it, so I wanted to create my own tool and so created &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/mindaslab/mk3&quot;&gt;mk3 or make tree&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gitlab.com/mindaslab/mk3/-/raw/master/mk3-logo.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I tried to write code for it, I got it all wrong, I took a break concentrated on other activities and the code just appeared out of nowhere. This time it took in account the power of Ruby programming language’s latest features, I coded it, and it worked like charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time, for very complex stuff I would go on to a state where I would just eat, watch T.V with chips, just do nothing, watch music video’s keep playing games. Sometimes I get flashes where I can see the code I imagined first getting refined, then that moment comes, may be every after 2 or 3 lazy days, the perfect answer. I would code it and it would work. It would take into account all the files I have checked to learn about the issue. It’s like magic, the Qui of coding. I don’t know how it works, but it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The I.T industry still thinks coding is like tightening bolts in a factory. No matter how modern a company wants to be seen, they want people to say how long they have worked. That’s rubbish I say. Have we found a way to meter thought? Have we found a way to continuously monitor brains energy usage? Have we found a way to measure efficiency of one brains neural structure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was once in a company called Zanec, my friends used to say a guy called Varadharajan used to sit behind me and note what I was doing, I used to watch music videos to clear off my brain for the Qui to happen, that poor guy might have not programmed in his life, he thought programming productivity was linearly proportional to the time spent before computers and chugging the keyboard. Thinking of those days brings me laughter. It also angers me to think how may life’s that guy had spoiled. But people like that survive in I.T companies where percapita employee productivity and earning is very low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I coded for another company Lumera, where it’s boss Venkatesh required us to have four meetings a day, one at morning 10:30 where we need to say what we plan to do today, at 2PM where we need to say what we have achieved till now, and I think at 5:30 PM for another status meeting. Apart from that we had a meeting at 7:30PM with client. It was hell coding there. You were under constant pressure to prepare for your speeches at the meeting. Apart from that if I said something if the boss did not like I need to have another calls with him which will drag and drag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeie4c32bfmlwnzn4hyb2kbym4y5wqydrpibbqy4rp2ddmkptfkyhaq.ipfs.dweb.link/garfield-eats.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the person who had worked there also told me that the boss called her and told that she should not have lunch breaks more than 30 minutes. A foodie herself she was put down. I also wished he told us how much time we could pee and poo. Another guy said, before I could join there, there will be a live Zoom call from 2PM - 4PM where they have to turn cameras on and code so that the boss can watch, so they do not sleep after lunch. Sadly though the company made money, it was very unproductive, made things insanely complicated, and hence people felt content putting a lot of effort into code to make small things happen and felt great about doing lot of inefficient work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I authored a tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doneit.in&quot;&gt;doneit&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a work logging app. I initially gave free trails to my friends, many of them came back to me and said it has got no way to log time, then “how can we measure productivity?” they asked. I sweet talked them, put down the phone, banged my head and felt sorry for the people who work under them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In I.T industry, when it comes to programming, the measure of productivity is what you have done, it doesn’t matter about the time. Your code should be understandable and scalable. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure how many programmers out there are working under non programming bosses who still have the industrial age mindset. I pity them, but to be productive, be shameless in the number of breaks you take and the time you take for breaks. Your brain is processing stuff subconsciously, and it will come out with the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
