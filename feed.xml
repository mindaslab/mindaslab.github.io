It was about Iran, how that country has a problem with stray dogs. People in Iran like to feed and stray dogs, and some dogs get rabies and attack people, sometimes killing them, many times infecting them with diseases. I was interested in the program because in Skylab Avenue, Sithalapakkam, we have the same problem. I think there are about 50 dogs in Skylab Avenue alone and people feed them relentlessly. I don’t understand why bring up such a wretched species will do any good to society?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DW program gave me the answer, it was quality of education they said. People with low quality of education never realize feeding stray dogs is a health hazard. It completely fitted with Skylab Avenue. I don’t see thinkers here, I just see people, who just do things because they do it. They have no brains to connect feeding dogs and public health hazard. They are just limited by their emotional values and won’t raise to the level of thought, and cannot think what’s good for the society and what’s good for the future. They simply can’t. You can’t expect an ant to write ‘As you like it’, it’s like that, it’s brain is too incapable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen both my neighbors feed strays. One of my neighbors has a dog, which barks who know at what time. At all ungodly hours it barks. I am sure that my dog neighbor is educated, but not educated enough, so they take their dogs on to street so that it has the luxury of going toilets right in a public place. They don’t clean up their mess. I’m sure they won’t even know what they are doing even in their deathbed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One having a dog is his own right, but make it not defecate on street, it’s a health hazard. If it’s barking, do have a nice soundproof, air-conditioned room and raise the dog there so that it does not disturb others. Have a dog that does not disturb and pollute the society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than my neighbors, its stray dogs in Skylab Avenue, Sithalapakkam that make my life hell. I don’t like to have Air Conditioners, I like natural air than the one that circulates in the room. Having my windows open I sleep, only to be disturbed by the dogs, the barking dogs of Skylab Avenue, and they bark loud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in Sithalapakkam, don’t buy idiyappam from the local vendor here, he feeds the dogs, if you buy idiyappam, you are cursed by me, and your family will go into ruin soon. Plus the dogs surround the idiyappam guy before he goes out to sell, who know what licks, paws have touched his hands that deliver idiyappam to you. There is also a guy, may be in his mid 50’s who goes for walk in the morning, and while returning, he empties a Good Day biscuit packet right in front of my home. Did I say quality educated people won’t feed strays? After emptying the packet, he just throws it on the street. My locality is cursed with such low quality people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a dead end in Skylab avenue, sharing border with Signature flats, there is a pink color home. Very strange thick glassed people live there. One woman there creases the dogs and I have seen her feed dogs with a cooker full of food! I don’t think she works, and she is definitely not educated I presume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chennai-mayor-sucks&quot;&gt;Chennai Mayor Sucks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a girl called Priya, and she is the Chennai mayor. I appreciate DMK making some one from a backward community as a Mayor, but can’t they make someone intelligent from a backward community as a mayor? When asked about what she is going to do about dogs that mauled a school boy in Chennai, she responded that they are going to take survey of dogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no mention of launching an investigation and terminating the dogs. There is no plan in Chennai to get rid of dogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;improved-quality-of-education-is-a-must&quot;&gt;Improved Quality of Education is a Must&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think Chennai people will stop feeding stray dogs any time soon. Ones brain and a whole city getting intelligent is tough. It’s very easy to slip into comfort and stupidity. As a city, as a state and as a nation, we must seek good quality of education so that people have the intelligence to think about the consequence of their action which stretches far beyond the instant emotional kick they get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pity Iran though, to keep Islam (or any religion) alive, people have to be kept stupid, so the problem of stray dogs will be there forever. But we as Indians have the freedom to exploit science, becoming intelligent and become a better society by eliminating stray dogs by better educating us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I was watching a program on DW TV or I think.

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of programmers who I encounter. The first one has an Indian middle class mentality, they are like yaa I was born, and I finished a degree, and so I &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; have a job, an income more than enough to support my family, these form bulk of Information Technology work force here in India. They also have other traits, the moment they get a salary you can see a change in their lifestyle, a new mobile, new dress, new blah blah. Looks like they are here to show off their new stuff than to apply technology to the betterment of humanity. This blog is not for those people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is for the hard-line people, THE PROGRAMMERS. This blog is for people who want to improve their programming despite the salary and other gains because they feel programming is cool. There are many stuff and books written about how to become and keep being a great programmer, almost all those books are about design patterns, they say do this kind of technique over others. I have read those kinds of books and felt that its authors are dumb. For me for some reason the design patterns and architectures they advocate in their books somehow flows naturally. Possibly that’s why I am in this field with relative ease. But for many that may not be the case, you must seek that knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is not about seeking knowledge, but it’s about maintaining a healthy mind. As a programmer you must solve very different problems every day, the problems may vary, your brain must be flexible. To keep your brain flexible you need to solve problems in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where can you find problems? May be love and marry a girl, and keep the marriage afloat! Or if you want real problem try criticizing Modi or claim that you want to destroy Hinduism because it’s based on myths than facts. You will be arrested and possibly killed or at lease physically mentally abused in police station. Don’t these techniques give you problems enough? :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay so where can you seek problems which makes you not deal with those animals? Well I do it in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mock-projects&quot;&gt;Mock Projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First is mock projects. Why does Iran make a mockup of American carrier and lets its fighters and army boats attack it? Why did Japanese pilots practiced hard and conducted mock raids on Pearl Harbor before the real attack. By doing mock projects you get some kind of familiarity, possibly mussel memory, and you will solve many problems in real projects withe ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In real environments things will be boring and repetitive. You may be having a lot of ideas about what you can do with the knowledge you have, but you must respond to your client or boss because they hold or control the money that flows to you, in such cases mock projects made me flex my neurons and see what I think can be made into practicality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even team up with your friends for some project. I do not do that personally because I am not a people’s person. I have huge intolerance for illogical humans, whenever I teamed up with people I feel my ideas are diluted by the ones of idiots. But if you feel teaming up with people will enhance your problem-solving skills, please do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thinking-solutions-to-problems&quot;&gt;Thinking Solutions to Problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to keep your brain active and thinking is to think about solutions to real world problems. Satellites launches are costly, energy intensive and needs a lot of planning, so I am thinking of an alternative solution. Why think about such crazy ideas? Because I can. Plus it keeps my brain working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can think about solutions to very hard problems, like how to end corruption in India. It’s very difficult, you could be killed trying to do it, so how can you do it? Hard problems stimulate one’s brain. The problems can be from math and computer science domain as well, it could also be a problem in your office, for example your office can be bureaucratic and full of politics, if you want to continue in such environment, then how to do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of solutions to problems to keep your brain healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;puzzles&quot;&gt;Puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puzzles are a great way to keep problem-solving mindset alive. There are a lot of puzzle books out there, there are puzzle websites and apps, so get them and start working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;math&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Math and computer science are interrelated. In fact computer science is a direct extension of math and number theory. Computers can do math billions of times faster than us, that’s it, that gives them these amazing powers. I have personally found solving math problems with machines is fun, and I am able to relate it to parts of real world problems like machine learning, searching, big data and numerical analysis. You may try it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;games&quot;&gt;Games&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer games, aka video games are popular among developers. I think they are the most popular mentally stimulating puzzle solving experience. Lot of programmers play games, usually they are game fanatics, which includes me too. Usually when you play games your brain will be motivated to get the highest score using the least possible effort. This motivation will help you research the game plan and find a way out. Many great computer programmers are game players too, almost all of us have tried to create a computer game as our side project. So, if possible try playing games which will improve your problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-it-easy&quot;&gt;Take it easy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to keeping your brain fit, some people seem to schedule it, now I am going to learn this, at this time I am going to solve a puzzle, and they overstretch. The aim of this article is to exercise your brain in a fun way. Unless you know something really perfectly you won’t be able to predict. Especially if you are stretching your self beyond your usual boundaries prediction and planning fails. So do not plan, go by the flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember this, solving problems should be part of programmers life, that will keep your brain healthy and possibly make you ignore stupidity of humanity and this life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Choice of not marrying</title><link href="/2024/07/03/choice-of-not-marrying.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Choice of not marrying" /><published>2024-07-03T21:27:00+05:30</published><updated>2024-07-03T21:27:00+05:30</updated><id>/2024/07/03/choice-of-not-marrying</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2024/07/03/choice-of-not-marrying.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Indian_marriage_in_India.jpg/2560px-Indian_marriage_in_India.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s awful for Indian families to push girls into marriage. We are not having high quality marriages in recent days I feel. Both girl and boy should be committed for the marriage to be successful. Sadly it’s okay if a boy does not marry, or marries many times, but girls don’t have the choice. Fake honor is pinned on them, they must marry, and only once they must do it (though today’s girls have bestie, boyfriend, whoever and whatever before and may be after marriage, but this blog is not about that). That sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling that most girls are not of marriage quality, they don’t want to get married, they just want to live alone and die. They have no family values, if this kind of low quality stuff are pushed on a boy’s head, then the life of boys becomes bad. Let’s say a boy really wants a family life, a kid, understand what a family is, and imagine him ending up with a low quality girl, unfit for a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a wife is tough, being a mother is tough. Not all good wives can be good mothers, and not all good mothers can be good wives. So being a good mother and good wife is super rare. I have gut feeling that only 1 out of 10 girls really want to get married, others just marry to put scene, show off and to have money for shopping. So in that 10%, how may of them can still be a good wife, and good mother to children. It dwindles, may be 1%. That’s why even though married men live longer, maybe they are kept alive by their wives for the money, and because society demands it, we all know the truth that married men are more willing to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If families and Indian customs allow girls to be single, then only those who really want to marry will list for marriage, and hence a lot of boys life’s will be saved. I honestly feel t’s better to die, than to end up with a moo-devi (a girl who wants makes you think of committing suicide). Time won’t be wasted for finding a good wife, since society is okay with girls not getting married, the chance of one ending up with high quality wife is increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian marriage law sucks, if a couple find themselves in stale marriage, they must wait a year for divorce. It means you have to sacrifice more than 1% of your life, just because your marriage sucks, that’s totally unproductive. We know that fast iterations and trial and error leads to best results, so may be reducing the time from 1 year to 3 months will boost marriage productivity 4X, thus increasing nation’s mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We as a nation must drop the concept that marriage is divine and embrace the truth that marriage is for fucking (on demand if one is lucky), and there is nothing special about it, dogs, rats, bats fuck, we are not alone. If we come to that conclusion, then as a next step, we can make prostitution legal, so men and women can be satisfied, and only really serious ones will end up in committed fruitful marriages.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How A.I will make every software a Free Software</title><link href="/2024/06/16/how-ai-will-make-every-software-a-free-software.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How A.I will make every software a Free Software" /><published>2024-06-16T17:16:00+05:30</published><updated>2024-06-16T17:16:00+05:30</updated><id>/2024/06/16/how-ai-will-make-every-software-a-free-software</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2024/06/16/how-ai-will-make-every-software-a-free-software.html">&lt;p&gt;I was watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucXYWG0vqqk&quot;&gt;Richard Stallman interview&lt;/a&gt; on Youtube, it was sad how evil capitalists destroyed the hacker culture and brought in the reign of proprietary software. Most software we use, like in our phones and computers or other gadgets, hide something malicious. We are unable to see and reverse engineer what it is. Big money wants to shackle and spy on us, and almost everyone on this planet has submitted to them for convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend every one to learn who &lt;a href=&quot;https://stallman.org&quot;&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt; is, and what &lt;a href=&quot;https://fsf.org&quot;&gt;Free Software&lt;/a&gt; is. You will understand you are most probably shackled by proprietary software, and maybe you will think about getting unshackled from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is about the light at the end of tunnel I see. I feel A.I will make every software a Free Software in near future. Say there is a binary on your computer, or mobile, or your microwave, one day you will be able to feed it to a neural network, and it will output the source code that can create the very same binary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way to create such a neural network is very straight forward. You have lots of source code in Github, GitLab, Codeberg and so on, take look at the image below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://archive.org/download/every-software-a-free-software/Every Software a Free Software.webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All we need to do is to take those code / library / projects, compile them to machine code for various processor architectures (say Risc V, ARM, x86), feed the compiled code and source to a neural network for it to learn. With lots of examples, neural network will learn to create source code from binary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software is created on ones computer, so, one can claim he / she has reverse engineered it (with the help of A.I), and release it in the license one wishes. I am sure many free software enthusiasts will release it under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html&quot;&gt;GPLV3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can automate this process, we can have a distributed computers scanning for binaries on the internet, reverse engineering it to code, and releasing equivalent Assembly, C++, Rust, Zig or what ever under GPLV3, thus making them libre to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we can have some programs in our computers that will scan it for binaries and feed it to this A.I liberator, so that all our software could be unshackled.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I was watching Richard Stallman interview on Youtube, it was sad how evil capitalists destroyed the hacker culture and brought in the reign of proprietary software.

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Chandrababu Naidu, 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; CM of Andhrapradesh&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was watching news today, Chandrababu Naidu took oath as Chief Minister of Andhra. I wish him all the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not like the way his swearing in ceremony went. Administration is about giving a good rule to people. It’s about having constant touch with people and responding to their needs. You need workers who go from door to door and listen to them, you need people who care about people so that plans get executed, and you need people who are good brained ones to make things efficient. These sorts of people should be besides you to rule a state, but the kind of people I saw was appalling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Pawan Kalyan (a cine star) is the deputy CM. All you need to rule people these days is to jump around like a monkey before camera it seems. There was Chiranjeevi, Rajinikanth. Why? Why are these people needed for swearing in? It looks absolutely stupid from an intellectual point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish there was no Modi and Venkaiya Naidu. These people represent a party (BJP) that’s based on religion and blind faith, they do not represent rule by facts and statistics. But yes, compared to film stars, the presence of these people is okay, but it could have been avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine, what will happen if Mamooty or Mohanlaal became the leader of Kerla’s parties, and finally became its CM? I am sure all Malyali’s will commit suicide in shame. If a state of Kerala can be so alert and choose right people (relatively right, definitely not absolutely right they are) compared to its neighbors, why can’t people of Andhra wake up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think Tamilnadu is far behind Andhra when it comes to shamefully allowing cine stars to become politicians. I have no hope that in another 100 years, Tamilnadu will have a golden Chief Minister like Kamaraj.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Chandrababu Naidu, 13th CM of Andhrapradesh</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Questions about Modi’s meditation</title><link href="/2024/06/03/questions-about-modis-meditation.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Questions about Modi&apos;s meditation" /><published>2024-06-03T08:49:00+05:30</published><updated>2024-06-03T08:49:00+05:30</updated><id>/2024/06/03/questions-about-modis-meditation</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2024/06/03/questions-about-modis-meditation.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/8vtunh5_modi-meditation_625x300_01_June_24.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never knew Modi Meditated in Vivekanandha rock. It’s nice to see that Tamilnadu’s media ignores this narcissist psychopath.  I also feel sad that killers like Modi, and Edapaadi Palani Sami are able to be in Tamilnadu, and they can walk this land without any fear. It does not mean that I don’t accuse DMK, look at all the cyanide deaths of people associated with them. They are yet to kill Savukku Shankar, and I am sure they will succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping those thoughts aside, this is about Modi’s meditation on Vivekanandha rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-much-did-it-cost&quot;&gt;How much did it cost?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much did it cost? I do have a comfortable living, but huge sums of my earnings goes as taxes, so when ever leader take a break, why don’t we have a public announcement in paper that Modi had gobbled up say 1000 crores of your money to meditate for 45 hours? Why do government hide this kind of data, and put full page ads, saying that this and that are their achievements, when all they have done is their duty? These kinds of transparency will make the people wake up, and ask the right questions so that our mirage of democracy gets exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So does it mean this government want people to be dumb so that they can rule this nation unchallenged?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-i-pay&quot;&gt;Why should I pay?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Modi opens a nuclear plant, or a scientific institution, a library, a education place, yes I am ready to pay. Why should I pay for this psychopath to sit in at place for social media likes? That’s absurd. If this guys wants to do this stupid stuff, why can’t he pay from his pocket? Or ask the party of terrorist (aka the Bharathiya Janatha Party) to pay? They are stupids, and so would believe Modi without a question and would pay.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fascist DMK attacks journalistic freedom in Tamilnadu</title><link href="/2024/05/20/fascist-dmk-attacks-journalistic-freedom-in-tamilnadu.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fascist DMK attacks journalistic freedom in Tamilnadu" /><published>2024-05-20T08:20:00+05:30</published><updated>2024-05-20T08:20:00+05:30</updated><id>/2024/05/20/fascist-dmk-attacks-journalistic-freedom-in-tamilnadu</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2024/05/20/fascist-dmk-attacks-journalistic-freedom-in-tamilnadu.html">&lt;p&gt;I saw a video where a Netherlands politician was speaking how Islam is incompatible with democracy and European values, his remarks were tolerated in Europe. In Europe, I think they have draw Muhammad day, where people draw pictures of prophet Muhammad. For some reason Muslims don’t like the picture of their own prophet dawn, that’s strange. In Arabia, even if you love the prophet, and draw his picture, I think you will be beheaded. For some reason their culture is so intolerant. For reasons, I can’t understand they can’t tolerate their own God been drawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These incidents have made me think, yes Europe is a democracy, whereas the Arabs are undemocratic who curtail freedom and thought of human mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tamilnadu kind of projects itself as modern state in India. Like Islam, the north of India is drenched in Hnduism, and there is no press freedom. Almost all press channels are bought by the ruling BJP, and what ever the BJP thinks should be in the news, will be in the news. Tamilnadu does not have BJP rule, and there is a bit more press freedom. In fact Tamilnadu is more democratic than North India. But recent acts by the DMK, has made journalistic freedom questionable in Tamilnadu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;savukku-shankar&quot;&gt;Savukku Shankar&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Savukku Shankar&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Savukku Shankar is referred to as Julian Assange of Tamilnadu. He is able to get information about Tamilnadu government and political families, and is bold enough to publish them. The transparency he brings is unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is excellent in exposing the DMK family. For three generation, this family is ruling Tamilnadu like the North Korean Kim family. The party DMK is totally undemocratic, members of one family, the Karunanidhi family dominate it. None in the party is brave to question the family and bring a system where people with merit become leaders. I think Savukku Shankar has exposed people like the Chief Minister Stalin, Stalin’s wife, Stalin’s son Udhayanidhi, Stalin’s daughter-in-law and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DMK desperately want’s Udhayanidhi Stalin, the current chief ministers son to be become next Chief Minister, and they desperately want Inbha Nidhi, the current Chief Minister’s grandson to be Chief Minister after that, so that families closer to the leader’s family could loot the nation. Savukku Shankar’s expose is embarrassing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;talk-about-some-police-guy-called-arun&quot;&gt;Talk about some police guy called Arun&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like Savukku Shankar got a tip off about a police guy Arun. He claimed on television that lady police working under Arun got promoted because they had affairs with Mr. Arun. Now the police and the DMK political family of Tamilnadu was waiting for something to get revenge on Shankar. On the basis that he defamed lady police, Savukku Shankar was arrested, in the Jail cell his arm was broken, and its alleged that he is tortured every day. Some sources say , its the goal of DMK to kill Savukku Shankar in jail, as they are unable to digest his boldness and his fighting spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defaming-shankar&quot;&gt;Defaming Shankar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To defame Shankar, police has claimed he possessed narcotics. If this isn’t true, it would give a hard time for the police. There are sponsored moth pieces on Youtube, may be sponsored by the DMK and Tamilnadu Secret Service who bad mouth about Shankar to change public view about him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multiple-cases&quot;&gt;Multiple cases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tamilnadu police is collecting multiple cases against Shankar, so that he could be kept in jail for a long time, maybe they don’t want him to contest against Udhayanidhi Stalin in upcoming Tamilnadu elections, as intelligence gather by Shankar about Stalin’s family could give him an edge and possibly a victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;falix-and-redpix&quot;&gt;Falix and Redpix&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Felix - runs RedPix&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Savukku Shakar’s opinion was aired on a Youtube channel called Redpix. It’s run by a person called Felix. Though this channel in it Disclaimer, displayed that it detaches from the opinion of the people interviewed by it, the channel’s owner Felix is arrested. This I feel is true murder of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felix is super innocent, and by arresting him, what DMK is trying to say is, if anyone talks bad about DMK, they and people who propagate such information will be squashed using the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-democracy-should-allow-freedom-of-opinion&quot;&gt;Why democracy should allow freedom of opinion?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is a democracy and opinion’s even if its false should be tolerated. For example, there is no God, yet India tolerates religion that say God’s Satan’s and spirits exists. We don’t keep arresting holy men for propagating false information and deceiving people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arab people can’t tolerate if someone gives shape to their God Muhammad, but Europe being a democracy tolerates it as I have written at the starting of the blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current Chief Minister Stalin himself violated many things and cheated people, yet we tolerate him. For example, he campaigned without taking Covid precautions. See his campaign video’s on YouTube. He accelerated Covid in Tamilnadu. Yet after coming to power, he shamelessly asked people to donate to fight Covid. He hasn’t been charged yet for killing Tamils, and he hasn’t been charged for cheating people by asking funds to fight Covid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democracy is tolerance of opinion. Savukku expressed his opinion on Redpix, either accept it or think it’s false. All Mr. Arun could have done is to issue a statement of denial, and asked Shankar for evidence. If Shankar did provide evidence, then we can think he is right, or we can think he is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how simple democracy is. Democracy is all about debating, educating people so that they can see through lies, think deeply about stuff and tell their opinion what ever it may be, and accept or reject other’s opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What DMK does is pure fascism. A rule of terror, unprecedented since the last Jayalalitha’s era, and I feel we people must strongly support journalists like Savukku Shankar and Felix.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I saw a video where a Netherlands politician was speaking how Islam is incompatible with democracy and European values, his remarks were tolerated in Europe. In Europe, I think they have draw Muhammad day, where people draw pictures of prophet Muhammad. For some reason Muslims don’t like the picture of their own prophet dawn, that’s strange. In Arabia, even if you love the prophet, and draw his picture, I think you will be beheaded. For some reason their culture is so intolerant. For reasons, I can’t understand they can’t tolerate their own God been drawn.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">99.99% of engineers are going to be junk</title><link href="/2024/05/15/99.99-percent-of-engineers-are-going-to-be-junk.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="99.99% of engineers are going to be junk" /><published>2024-05-15T09:39:00+05:30</published><updated>2024-05-15T09:39:00+05:30</updated><id>/2024/05/15/99.99-percent-of-engineers-are-going-to-be-junk</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2024/05/15/99.99-percent-of-engineers-are-going-to-be-junk.html">&lt;p&gt;Saw in News today that 1.3 Lakh Tamils are applying for the course of engineering. It startled me. I thought people would be aware that Engineering colleges are junk, in fact student goes in and comes out even forgetting the calculus he learned in 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He would be so out of touch with industry. I feel that once finishing 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; standard, one must take internship in industry, no matter what, if its software, foundry, steel forging or something. I am sure within 3 years they can come up to industry standards, and work better than a new college graduate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since people who go for mad rush for engineering, with just money in their mind, they tend to be too low quality, unemployable, utter waste to society may be even 10 years after graduation. It’s only after that they seem to pick up something, but lose their race in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colleges have sprung up, and are working for decades to tap in peoples desire to study engineering in an attempt to become rich. These colleges are nothing but social clubs, where bunch of people meet for 4 years and leave as more idiots than they were  at their 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are student, or a parent, and if you want to live a proper and fulfilling life, think. Think what has happened to our nation? Why are roads built don’t last long? Why are streets so hot? And why people who have built it never knew we are a summer land and have planned accordingly? Why are there floods and drought? Why don’t we have a system so simple that it can save water?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think why things are not managed properly? And think why our bosses are stupid? And how could stupid us be bosses of so many people better thinkers than us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think why don’t things last, and why things cannot be repaired easily, though we claim we are progressing technically? Think why our lives are difficult than our grandparents?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think why we don’t see first class mathematicians, poet’s, artists and movie-makers who could make a decent and intellectual films that are entertaining?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think do you want to spend for years in a stupid factory voiding your family’s fortunes, or you want to have a life of a human?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Saw in News today that 1.3 Lakh Tamils are applying for the course of engineering.

They say this is your salary, and then they say this much is what you get because other part is a variable pay. Then they have cheated you. They have told an amount, but have effectively reduced your salary by play of words. I wonder what the labor minister in India does even if such practices are done on huge scale, costing the country crores?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way companies loot employees in the name of variable pay is, they give the variable pay. Let me say how it’s looting. Let’s say I should have got a pay of Rs 10,000/- last month, but I am getting it after 3 months, since it’s variable. Now, let’s do the math. If I put 18% pa as interest, for a month I would have earned Rs 10149.99/-, that is about Rs 150/- as interest. Now compounding this for 3 months, it would be Rs 10456.78/-, or I had lost Rs 456.78/-, the company since it’s doing business, it would have made far more money by holding my variable pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though company makes this money, company does not give me the right of ownership, voting rights or nothing. They just loot me and make money out of it. In fact its looting of Indian’s in broad daylight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will The Government Wake Up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we all know that practically Indian politicians are immune to law, and they can do what ever they want. What surprises me is this, say for example Prajwal, he is from Gowda family, which must have looted tens of thousands of crores from nation, he can get any willing girl for himself, the world is awash with call girls. Then why go on a difficult path of forcing someone, and rape them? It makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;

In Arabia the rich are immune to law too, just like India, and they buy as many girls as they want. They have infinite money flow from oil, our Indian politicians have infinite money flow by looting us. So why can’t our politicians and their families follow the Arab way and just buy girls when ever they want, rather than get caught in scandal and lose their loot in subduing the law?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Recently H.D.Deva Gowda’s son and grandson are accused of raping their domestic worker I think, and law has let his grandson Prajwal escape and go to Germany.</summary></entry></feed>
