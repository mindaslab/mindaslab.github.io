&lt;p&gt;I am sure the above task will fail 99.99% of Tamilnadu’s electronic engineers and at about 80% of India’s electronic engineers. It could be possible that 50% of all HOD’s in electronics department in Tamilnadu will fail in this task too, those who succeed would have accomplished with tremendous difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, if you ask an electronics engineer to do this task as an interview exercise, the person will look at you like you are insane and mad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say college education is sham, and it loots middle class parents because they are ignorant, I mean it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Task: Implement RTL NAND on PCB that operates on 5V power supply.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fundamentals of a Business</title><link href="/2022/06/18/fundamentals-of-a-business.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fundamentals of a Business" /><published>2022-06-18T15:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-06-18T15:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/06/18/fundamentals-of-a-business</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/06/18/fundamentals-of-a-business.html">&lt;p&gt;I was talking with my friend who wanted to have his own business. I soon found out that he wanted to have a business to get rich, to leave something for his kids, which means his business has failed even before it materialized. He never talked about the three main things which I think is essential for a business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog I want to write what qualities I think are fundamental for a business, what qualities I think that will make it successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;value&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first fundamental thing is value. Some one wants to buy your product or service only if they think it’s valuable, or else they have to be a fool to invest money. No matter how ever less value it is, your business must add value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example I was consulting for a company called DataMaking, our team size grew a lot, we had to do something to keep meeting times low, so we developed a tool &lt;a href=&quot;https://doneit.in&quot;&gt;doneit&lt;/a&gt;. It reduced our meeting times. After it worked for us, we told our friends to try, gave them free trials and some of them became paid subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some value for a tool creation, we could identify it and so we created it. It later became a business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;honesty&quot;&gt;Honesty&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honesty is necessary for business. Say you have a bank backing you, they want to know how your business will go so that they can predict the future and make sure there is enough funds available to the creditors. If you are dishonest, they will not be able to help you in the long run and will loose trust in you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not honest about the product or service you are selling to someone, people will loose trust in it. For example almost no startups use Oracle, no programmer uses Windows. People have lost trust in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;equality&quot;&gt;Equality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today SpaceX is doing real magic in space industry, but I don’t think it will be successful in the long run. Elon Musk treats people like shit, does not value dissent. Business is for people and by people. If one does not recognize the equality of people, a business is doomed to fail in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a business crosses 3 workers, the owner of the business has no real control of it, he has to consult people to take next decision, it becomes more of a democratic process. If a worker in a business doesn’t like it, crack will appear, will widen, and the business will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the responsibility of people who say that they can run a business to make sure all have equal stake in the business.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I was talking with my friend who wanted to have his own business.

It’s very true. A girl called Nupur Sharma from my country India told something wrong about the Prophet Muhammed, and immediately her party the BJP which is known for killing Muslims suspended her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeicvkmcuikgsg4ksrwgsnpfqwq663koxkydz75jqb5jtrepsyuhoty.ipfs.dweb.link/nupur-sharma.webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Nupur Sharma&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am dead against BJP, their philosophy of intolerance. they must tolerate other religions than hinduism I feel, and they being the ruling party should defend the right of Indian to speak anything he wants rather than bowing to vote bank pressure and throwing out Nupur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This girl having said something about Muhammad now is facing death threats from hardline Islamists. The funny thing is none really knows if prophet Muhammad existed. We today know God is not there and it’s impossible for him to have spoken to Muhammad or Munnusamy. May be if Muhammad existed it would have been an illusion, just like the ones Nithyanadha get’s these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;

    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RqDY8Kbx3dE?color=white&amp;amp;theme=light&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/iframe&gt;
     &lt;/figure&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These people may not even know they are fools, they think what they envision is true, and their belief makes us believe what they say. Unless scientific thinking pervades over all humanity, religion and people who are been cheated by it will exist. It’s very energy efficient for our brains to take in as truth what most say, rather than compute from basic facts and arrive to a conclusion whats is the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically humans have scientific and logic thought. Though many believe God is there, and he is answering us and is almighty, none, not even the true believer says “God I want a samosa to appear before me”, instead they goto a shop and buy it which is scientifically proven to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;india-is-not-arabia&quot;&gt;India is Not Arabia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know why the Arabs don’t want to question Islam and reform in big way. I am also very sure almost no Arab is a true Muslim and has reformed in some way. They must know India is not Arabia. Here we question Gods, comment about it, scold God in prayer, rate it, fall in love with it, marry it, give it name, give it form, make it multiply, transform and make it compete against itself. It’s my God here, not a God defined by some one in some book. The theological philosophy and thinking in India goes far beyond, may be to the days when Arabia was evergreen forrest. It’s far mature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here talking about God even in negative terms is not bad, though hardline Hindus are trying to turn India into an Arab like state where their notion of religion is right and others is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeiacokmzjjaalccwpmu57hdbhixuksmnhnxaqtc4uvomfww4qompji.ipfs.dweb.link/story_647_091715100533.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;M.F.Hussein&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example hardline Hindus have forced M.F.Husein out of this nation just because he drew Goddess Saraswati naked. It’s his version of her and he is entitled to have it. Once again none knows if a girl called Saraswati existed and she played veena, and did so much good to society that she was worshiped as God. She could just be an imagination form a persons brain who was smoking a pot at that time! Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arabs should know that this is India where opinions are tolerated and not banished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example Arabs could not tolerate some one drawing prophet Muhammad, I don’t know why. When ever I imagine Muhmmad I see a man towing a camel with a beard, in white Arabic robe, I don’t see something like a light bulb or blof of light moving like an UFO around and saying Allah said this and that. That would scare people off. Even Europeans imagine Muhammad as a person and draw him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeielvruqa2yjk23jdfa2ullm72aoflvodkp3dmmhdr7yxk5fxmioxu.ipfs.dweb.link/muhmah1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Cartoon of Prophet Muhammad by Europeans&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They even have a day called Draw Muhammd day just to tell the Arabs that in Europe one has the right to imagine and visualize, and it’s not bad. For some reason which I cannot understand, Arabs do not like a visual representation of their own prophet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly Arabs must realize that India is much of a free nation than Arabia where people control what other should even think, eat, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quran-spells-trouble-to-india&quot;&gt;Quran spells trouble to India&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we don’t know if Muhammad exist or not, in Quran it’s said that Rome and India will be converted to Islam, and hard line Muslims still hold it true. They do all crazy things like sending terrorist from Pakistan, trying to take off Kashmir and Punjab away from India and all those nonsense. People never seem to realize that laws of Physics work, but human belief sometimes work and sometimes doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;defeating-the-islamic-empire&quot;&gt;Defeating the Islamic Empire&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently Saudi Arabia earns $1 billion a day, and part of it definitely used to create people to kill us. Like Gandhis Salt and Kadhi protest, if we change our consumer behavior we can mitigate some attacks on us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;electric-vehicles&quot;&gt;Electric Vehicles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money we spend for petroleum goes to Arabs, if you can switch your car or bike to electric, you are saving money in the long run, and coal power plants get coal mostly from Australia which won’t get mad if we talk something about Pope or Jesus or something, and Aussies won’t sponsor killing of Indians. That will put a dent in Arab revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solar-cell-roof-tops&quot;&gt;Solar cell roof tops&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get solar cell roof tops, it will charge your electric vehicle and make your commute cost almost to zero. If we can generate electricity from Kashmir to Kaniyakumari and share it on grid, we can even eliminate diesel and crude oil power plants that take our money to Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solar-water-heaters--cooking&quot;&gt;Solar water heaters / cooking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t afford costly solar cell roof tops, try to go with solar water heater, try using solar cooker. If you can save LPG by cooking with preheated water, or if you can cook with solar power, we are denying that revenue to Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-travel-in-qatar-airlines&quot;&gt;Don’t travel in Qatar Airlines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qatar Airways though awesome feeds money to Arabia. Try not to travel in it. If you have planned tours in Islamic countries cancel it. This will put a dent in their revenue from us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stop-working-for-arab-nations&quot;&gt;Stop working for Arab nations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are planning for job in Arab nation, reconsider. Consider Europe, Australia, Canada or even USA. Personally I don’t like USA as all it’s been able to do is genocide, but at least in theory they support free speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/RUEDA_DE_PRENSA_CONJUNTA_ENTRE_CANCILLER_RICARDO_PATI%C3%91O_Y_JULIAN_ASSANGE_%28cropped%29.jpg/810px-RUEDA_DE_PRENSA_CONJUNTA_ENTRE_CANCILLER_RICARDO_PATI%C3%91O_Y_JULIAN_ASSANGE_%28cropped%29.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;USA? Free Speech?&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are working in Arab nations, try switching job to some other nation. I am sure Arabs see us as slaves than workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;educate-people-about-religion&quot;&gt;Educate people about religion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeiciilsauxaxtcotxz3bzd76wlgnikdhvfjeaqkfwkwyr2d7kwjqna.ipfs.dweb.link/periyar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Periyaar&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most important thing. We in Tamilnadu had Periyaar to educate us about truth. Europeans had James Randi, they have Richard Dawkins etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Richard_Dawkins_Cooper_Union_Shankbone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for the Islamic world? Are voices been suppressed believing a baseless millennium old book? When will Muslims improve? Know the truth? Shed their religion and embrace rational thought?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will the descendants of Muslims 100 years from now be a modern human, or some one who upholds cock and bull stories? We the rationalists must reach out. May be economically draining out Arabia is a temporary solution, but in long run we must empower them to embrace science and have a rational thought.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Religion is poison said Chairman Mao.

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;M.K.Stalin, leader of DMK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing new in this blog. DMK is known for it huge nation wide corruption, rowdy and murderous cadres, nepotism. One thing they stood by till the time Vajpyee became priminister was that they were bit anti religious, but were they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DMK claims to be a non religious party and its UPA is non religious, but all these days they are in alliance with some muslim parties which even muslims don’t think it’s worth to exist. Many muslims either vote for DMK or ADMK, but DMK claims that they have non religious alliance having alliance with Islamic parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Tamil they will say that &lt;em&gt;to hide a full pumpkin in a plate of rice&lt;/em&gt;, by having alliance with religious party then telling they are non religious, is it believable? Any way as Tamils we all know DMK will do any thing to earn money and be in power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BJP is a shame to this nation. When Babri Masjid was demolished, Vajpyee said that a symbol of shame had been destroyed. Well, let’s say that ancient Islamic kings did demolish Tamples and built Mosques there, should we be intolerant to Muslims because of few scoundrels like them? May be they (kings of that time) did not have enough data, they were exposed only to Islam and might have been brought up been told that non Muslims are fit for nothing. Today we have science, we understand all humans are equal, and religion and ones spiritual belief is immaterial. In this age Vajpyee (who we considered an intellectual) saying such a thing is a shocker. I strongly feel existence of RSS and BJP is not needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modi conducted Gujrath genocide killing lot of Muslims. He is a un-educated idiot filled with narcism, nothing can be done about it, we can hope that some miracle would happen and he would die, but he does keep his health top notch any way. Modi thinking wrong about minorities in India is one thing, but Vajpyee not forgiving mistakes done by the muslim invaders is worry-some. DMK having an alliance then with Vajpyee BJP was immoral and shame to Dravidian society as a whole. DMK is not a dravidian party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vajpyee led well, he did not pursue Hindutava because of aligning with DMK, but I felt a Dravidian party has fell down the ladder of morality by having alliance with a religious parties. Ideally DMK should not have alliance with any religious party if they utter the word of Periyaar and rationalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ideal DMK member should educate people that God does not exists, and what exists is real. A DMK guy should make one think, ask questions like how likely that a party is worth existing if Grandpa, Dad, and Son are the leaders without much contest. They must think, question, be brave and rational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Edapaadi’s rule when Modi visited Chennai, DMK was loved by Tamils as it took to the slogan &lt;em&gt;Go Back Modi&lt;/em&gt;. But now? Just for it’s survival, for power, for Udhayanidhi to be next CM, and for the center to turn blind eye to corruption in Tamilnadu, Modi is welcomed here. This is a blow to DMK’s moral stand, and I don’t think a party and / or a leader who would switch morals to stay in power is worthy of existence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">M.K.Stalin, leader of DMK</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why Amit Shah started language war and Modi wants to end it?</title><link href="/2022/05/20/why-amit-shah-started-language-war-and-modi-wants-to-end-it.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why Amit Shah started language war and Modi wants to end it?" /><published>2022-05-20T20:11:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-05-20T20:11:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/05/20/why-amit-shah-started-language-war-and-modi-wants-to-end-it</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/05/20/why-amit-shah-started-language-war-and-modi-wants-to-end-it.html">&lt;p&gt;Everything was not okay in India. Fuel prices have crossed Rs 100, gas cylinder prices crossed Rs 1000 which is higher than some family’s monthly earnings, inflation is touching double digit and Modi was claiming &lt;em&gt;ache din&lt;/em&gt; which means people are having a good day under his rule. There is an economic collapse in Srilanka, and people have woken up, in India people are still sleeping. This would give chill to any ruler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take Romans, their problems were caused by the uncivilized barbarians raiding their territory. If you take Hitler’s Germany, it’s the Jews who caused problems. If you take USA, their problems were caused by the Red Indians, then Blacks, The Soviets, now Mexicans and Chinese. If you take Srilanks, their problems are caused by Tamils. If you take India, they say our problems are caused by Muslim and Christians, and now all of a sudden by Tamils says Modi without mentioning us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout History a pattern emerges, if the people place a ruler who cannot rule, definitely the nation would sink, for the incapable ruler to be in power he would like to have a scape goat to blame, the usual template is for the incapable ruler to associate himself with the majority and blame the minority or an enemy state. If the populace is kept uneducated they will fall to such propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the eyes of the Indian commoner life is becoming insanely tough, we have a clown ruling our nation who has no idea about economics and possibly won’t even listed to good economic advisors. So naturally the clown tells Amit Shah to say that Hindi should replace English in India as a ruling language, this they know would cause stir and would aid people forget the economic crisis. But for how long? In the long run it seems not to work, and never the center is able to answer the questions asked by people who are proud of their language and would resist Hindi imposition. So this could back fire. Some how the BJP has forgotten that Hindi imposition taken up by congress failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amit Shan might have thought his words might fuel wide scale protest and some language speaking people could be announced as problem makers and Modi’s India could have blame them and turn the majority against them thus proving BJP as the guardian of the majority. It seems not to work. We are too diplomatic in dealing with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for some reason they want to end it and Modi is claiming that some one is starting language wars, I think Modi is now thinking that people have forgotten that Amit Shah has started it recently. Well may be BJP supporters will forget, but what about people who have brains and think? Will they fall into this trap?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Everything was not okay in India.

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if Vivek watched this news clip and made his joke. ROFL.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">He fantasized such kind of stupids could exist:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Oruthee, a good movie with few glitches</title><link href="/2022/05/15/oruthee-a-good-movie-with-few-glitches.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Oruthee, a good movie with few glitches" /><published>2022-05-15T10:14:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-05-15T10:14:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/05/15/oruthee-a-good-movie-with-few-glitches</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/05/15/oruthee-a-good-movie-with-few-glitches.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.sify.com/uploads/oruthi-ubpmwaaehbcib.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always looked at Malayalam films with amazement. Why can’t we Tamils make films like them? Yes we did have this Jai Bhim which rocked the movie world and kicked off few Vanniyar Terrorist into action for their personal gains, that movie is just one in ten thousand, or perhaps one in a million. The movie that rocked terrorist before was Roja by Maniratnam, terrorist even threw bombs in his home proving his greatness. I also enjoyed Writer and Thaanakaaran recently to be fair with Tamil films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some how Malyaalis are able to make films that are believable, relatable and with good stories which we Tamils are unable to do, and Teleugu people really really suck in making movies. I totally avoid Telugu movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently watched Oruthee, which was good, except but few dramatic scenes. It’s a good movie that shows how easily middle class people are exploited in this nation by rich, how the rich make their hard earned incomes vanish knowing that middle class has no choice. I personally think middle class are the broiler chicken of Indian rich, we are allowed to breed so that we can offer services to the rich and their dynasties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie also shows the foolishness of middle class people trusting the legal services offered by India, but this movie does not show if the legal service finally colludes with the rich and cheats them or does justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie too shows some police officers in Kerala are good people and do want to service the public. In Tamilnadu thats almost extinct! Here people simply do not trust the police. Due to incidents like Thutukudi Masacare; The case of Felix and Jayaraj; Thecase of Vignesh killing by the police, we in Tamilnadu call our police as Kollum Karangal (கொல்லும் கரங்கள்), which means killing hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oruthee is a movie that all middle class people in India, perhaps the middle class of the world should see. It also shows the plight of Kerala, where people can’t find work and had to goto work for nations that support terror activities against us. In that way I am proud of Tamilnadu, despite dynastic politics, a foolish party that worshipped a queen, we are some how able to provide better jobs though not the best. We Tamils are mostly slaves in our own land than being slaves in a foreign land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie also shows the stupid state of Kearla, over there looks like police complaints should be registered in foreign English than their own mother tongue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like the title, Oruthee (ஒருத்தி) means a single woman, or it can also be interpreted as a fire (ஒரு தீ). It depends the way women see themselves as. We all know how Kannagi saw herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happened during cold weather I think, I turned the tap and touched water, I just removed my hand since the water was extreme or very away from my body temperature, and a split second from it I sensed I just touched cold water and not hot so I proceeded further to wash my hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if some one has done research about it, but this pattern seems to be everywhere, the brain gets alert first when something triggers it, then it thinks about it and sees if something is positive or negative (or classifies it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May be this is an energy saving act of brain, if everything is done in parallel and with same energy intensity, then our brain will consume too much energy (which is costly in nature), may be it puts various parts to low energy state and triggers some parts to high energy or processing state after some activation. It’s very similar to we having multiple cores (some very specialized) on our computer and most of them are at sleep most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">When you touch something you sense it’s hot or cold, but my experience tells me that first brain first senses an extreme in temperature and only then it decides if some thing is hot or cold.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Never Derail</title><link href="/2022/05/11/never-derail.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Never Derail" /><published>2022-05-11T11:39:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-05-11T11:39:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/05/11/never-derail</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/05/11/never-derail.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-56799366,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-80923,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder how they think in 37 signals. According to me Ruby on Rails is a miracle web development framework. they selected very right language Ruby, they seem to have thought about how you can write very messy code with Ruby, so they put up a very opinionated framework called Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to think of learning Rails as learning to become an engine driver. Learning to walk is relatively easy; to go to a near by shop located at one’s street corner and buying few things, walking would suffice. If you want to goto a port and transport tonnes of coal to a power station 100 miles away you need a railway infrastructure, and that’s what Rails gives you. You need to learn about it all to become a Rails developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails promise’s one thing, if you obey it’s rules it would work fine, if you derail it, it’s just a pile of mess.  Being a Rails developer, to my astonishment I am seeing this promise come true again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog I am going to tell you how Rails was derailed many times in my career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;derailing-by-using-front-end-frameworks&quot;&gt;Derailing by using front end frameworks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails follows MVC architecture, the &lt;strong&gt;V&lt;/strong&gt; in that stands for View, yes Rails has got a view layer, and tremendous support for Ajax which can make pages dynamic and it has got this thing called Turbolinks till Rails 6 which makes clicking of links Ajax, and now it has got Turbo, a full fledged framework to support very dynamic pages that needs almost no refreshing. Using a front end framework is an anti-pattern. You are simply turning Rails into a  JSON or GraphQL source. If you do so decouple front end and back end development. Just use the Model and Controller in Rails and pump out data to be consumed by your devices like mobile app and front end framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a Rails developer to work on a  front end is like asking an engine driver to paint his train, no that won’t work. The paint job would be in a mess and would peel off any time. Rails developers are good at putting out HTML, JSON and GraphQL (that too when they know about it well). As of now not many Rails dev’s know GraphQL thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;derailing-thinking-that-full-stack-includes-design&quot;&gt;Derailing thinking that full stack includes design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again full stack does not include design. Designing requires a different kind of brain, it might also need to think about UI and UX. Rails is all about business logic delivered fast. Many people confuse that designing is a part of Rails and that gives us headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;derailing-by-using-unsupported-databases&quot;&gt;Derailing by using unsupported databases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Postgres is very much supported DB in Rails. The community has moved in that direction. I have seen projects where one uses Oracle or Microsoft SQL and see that Ruby does not work well with it. Use a data store that support Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also seen people using Mongo (or some weird NoSQL), and even Neo4j with Rails, and getting involved in productive bottlenecks. All I can say is you are a software engineer, think dude think. Don’t be dumb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your project has grown too large, try using something like Cockroach DB, that’s just drop in replacement to PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-activejob&quot;&gt;Use ActiveJob&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least in 3 project’s I saw Rails been used with Kafka, okay but hasn’t Rails got nicely integrated ActiveJob? The Rails community has realized the need of doing intensive tasks that could fail, and has provided an excellent abstraction layer. I see some companies using Sidekiq and ActivJob and processing nearly TB’s of machine generated data and generating more data due to it :D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kafka is great but integrate with Rails with a proper abstraction like an API where a Rails dev fires an API to create task and queries it to know its status. Kafka should be handled totally separate way. A Railway engineer should not worry about what happens to a parcel is delivered at a Railway station, messages to Kafka is like parcels a train delivers to a platform. Trying to push it into Rails may or may not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;follow-convection-over-configuration&quot;&gt;Follow convection over configuration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encountered a situation where emailing stuff was so abstracted from Rails, I had to define same email template in multiple locations. A lot of configuration should be set. I was given a reason for this, but I was not convinced. Use Rails convention. Never violate the rails way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails is battle tested, 37 signals and other top companies are using it, and they are iterating their products fast and moving along with trend. I believe they are right in many ways. So follow Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-creating-a-knowledge-base&quot;&gt;Not creating a knowledge base&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I do freelancing, I find in many projects the client fails to create knowledge base and documentation for his product. Never I have seen a document that says you need to have imagemagick installed on the server you are deploying, and that sucks. One should create a good enough knowledge base so that it gives lot of information to developers. If your developers are too techi and cannot write english, then hire some technical writers to assist them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never in a Rails project I have seen an architecture diagram describing if you need a redis connected to it, never have I seen a diagram if the current deployment is behind load balancers or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans can understand far better using diagrams than reading text, that too reading code is hard. So putting diagrams is not bad. May be consultancy should be formed to evaluate a companies tech knowledge base and reveal its shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tdd&quot;&gt;TDD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please! Yes do TDD 100%, please! Else forget about fast changes and upgrading your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails is very thought out, they have lasted the test of time, I think for two decades and they are still roaring like lions. I don’t know who chose the name Rails, but if you derail, things go awry like a real railway system. Either be on track, create knowledge for the driver to understand well when convention is broken, don’t break the convention too much so that it becomes hard for others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
