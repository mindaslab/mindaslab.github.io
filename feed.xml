&lt;p&gt;I am wondering why not Shakeela become the next Tamilnadu C.M. I feel she has
got all the qualities. She has been doing exceptionally good and things to
Tamilnadu’s youth as its described by actor Vijay here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;316&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OSzlvFqhIM8?color=white&amp;amp;theme=light&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well here are my points why she must become the Tamilnadu CM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Huge Fan Following&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shakeela has a huge fan following, more than what M.G.R had and more
than Rajini and Kamal combined. The youth love her more than Rajini and Kamal.
Well, I know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not an Tamil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If its fate of Tamilnadu not to be ruled by a Tamil, then why ruled by a ugly
looking non-Tamil than spectacular Shakeela?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Huge Assets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Election is all about having assets and sharing them at the right time to win
people’s hearts. Shakeela has sure more assets than Karunanidhi and Sasikala
family and she knows when and how to share them to win peoples heart’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big Heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This needs no explanation, but Tamils like C.M with big heart and a C.M who
is transparent and open. Who can beat Shakeela on that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good friends with Neighbours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tamilnadu is in conflict with neighbouring states due to water sharing and many
other issues. Shakeela is an actor who is popular there too. So the youth
of our neighbors will realize sharing is caring and would share their stuff
with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignorance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its the fate of Tamilnadu to have politically ignorant people as C.M. Any actor
can jump in then why not Shakeela?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well people what do you feel? I think it would be great if Shakeela becomes the
C.M. It will really get the youth interested in politics and prove glamor weighs
more than logic and truth.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Traffic police in Medavakkam are pathetic</title><link href="/2018/01/01/traffic-police-in-medavakkam-are-pathetic.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Traffic police in Medavakkam are pathetic" /><published>2018-01-01T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-01-01T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2018/01/01/traffic-police-in-medavakkam-are-pathetic</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2018/01/01/traffic-police-in-medavakkam-are-pathetic.html">&lt;p&gt;I have to drive through Medavakkam every day, and for past two weeks or more the
traffic police in Medavakkam are doing a pathetic job. They simply are not
regulating traffic, but just letting users determine when they must drive through
a junction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought the police were not present because they need to go and stand and
salute a politician who travels from point A to B in city. Politicians like
to be saluted by police a lot and one single politician here in Tamilnadu could
pull away 1000’s of police for such duty so that he feels powerful and great
about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing the politician says is he is threatened by anti nationals and
terrorist and his or her life is in danger, but the truth is terrorists and
Pakistanis won’t touch these people as ISI (Pak’s terror intelligence network)
knows that Indian politicians cause more damage to India than all terrorist in
this world combined. Terrorist have no way to escape law as they are uncorrupt
and admit to what they do and they don’t have any money to bribe officials
to get legal immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any way coming back to Medavakkam. I avoided bumping into vehicles and inched
my way and crossed the junction, and just after ten meter drive I saw a cop in
shade enjoying his days collecting bribes from motorist. What the hell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cop’s in Medavakkam junction collect bribes from all commercial vehicles. They
just corner these vehicles and expect bribes from any where from Rs 50/- to Rs
500/-, once bribed the vehicles are let go. They do the same with motorcyclist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no force that could stop them. Well collect bribes, India can
never be a uncorrupted nation. But once you collected bribe of Rs 1000/- at-least
divert traffic for an hour. Or pay some to divert traffic say Rs 150/- an hour
and you stay in  a shaded corner and collect bribes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish these cops are punished, but which cop in Tamilnadu is been really
punished for looting people?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I have to drive through Medavakkam every day, and for past two weeks or more the traffic police in Medavakkam are doing a pathetic job.

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was a great day. I felt like eating Briyani badly, one of my family
member purchased it and was on the way, then some one knocked. It was my neighbor
and what he had? Wow that was kind of unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The briyani tasted great. It was delivered to us because he was celebrating his
birthday. I shook hands with him but I said nothing. Did I wish? No! One may
ask why and why I don’t wish people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well its simple. You meet a person and you congratulate because one has a
father, a mother and he is breathing. Do it to some one and see. It will look
absurd. Why? Because its natural for all person to have these. Similarly for me
its very natural to have a birthday, new year, end of the year and other
festivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason I think its normal for a person to have a birthday, a death day,
so on and so forth. You have done nothing to deserve it. So why you need to
wish? It looks silly for me to wish people just because they are alive this new
year or this birthday. For some reason I don’t want to think that they or I will
be dead the next year so that we may not be able to wish each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a person has done something spectacular to amaze me, like some one made me
great briyani or a chicken soup which my wife makes (that bowls me down) I am
ready to congratulate them at that instant. Other times no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yday I had two briyani’s at a time and a food coma. Thanks for that if you
are my neighbor and read this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I Love Ruby comes to top</title><link href="/2017/12/27/I-Love-Ruby-comes-to-top.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I Love Ruby comes to top" /><published>2017-12-27T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2017-12-27T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2017/12/27/I-Love-Ruby-comes-to-top</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2017/12/27/I-Love-Ruby-comes-to-top.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ilr_at_top.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a pleasant surprise for me to type “I Love Ruby” on Google and to find that
my book has bubbled to the top finally. There were many reason why it did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I had no dedicated website for it. I was lazy and first published it out
of Dropbox. But Dropbox was an unethical company so I switched to Open mail box.
Open mail box had own cloud in it. But ll of a sudden open mail box maid these
features as paid and I was left in dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I moved to github and now the project is hosted there and it seems to
be okay. Any way if you are Rubyist you can get my book in the links provided

the business and find something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find not so easy as a programer and as an artist that businesses are not able
to understand ones skills and are unable to utilize ones talent. Imagine you are
an author in 1960’s, you write a novel, a publisher likes it and pays for you
to complete it. You complete it and goback to him, then he says that as a writer
you must understand the publishing business, you say you do, then he shows a
press machine and tells you to operate it. Imagine how stupid it will be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think its absurd to tell the writer to operate the press machine, you
should think how absurd Info Tech companies are operating in India and around
the world. People with money seem to have no clue how to run a company. People
have left programming a while ago and seem to forget how to be a programmer,
they seem to forget the pressures programmer faces.&lt;/p&gt;

My team is in a
state where it does not know what HTTP 500 error is. That too one is 10 year
experienced developer and another is 4. I raised an alarm that we may not make
it this sprint, and what I get as a reward? It was told to me that I am been
projected as a great guy who will fix things up, a kind of guy who will not fail,
a kind of Rommel under Nazi’s and hence I must make things to work. I was told I
am granted all powers which means I can torture any one I want to get things done.
Thats far far away from who I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These type of expectations put me down. I know who and what I am more than anyone
else (may be Google knows more as it spies on me all time) and I know my
capabilities, I know my laziness and how an hurricane would not
move me when I am lazy. I know what I can do and what I cannot. And some one
places a blind expectation on me and that person controls my earnings I surely
don’t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its not just in profession, its in society. A engineering mishap in my street
led to water stagnation. Some one had built an elevated barrier that obstructs
the flow of rain water to nearby pond. People in my street came up with an
idiotic idea for flood prevention, by elevating our road which would give us dry land but just would
push this problem further. When I pointed out we need a drain and not more barrier
I became a villain, but few people realized my logic and told me to run for elections!
Damn!!! I ain’t do this for power and popularity, I am just raising a problem
that my common sense put up to me. Thats it!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And not just society too, my family thinks I am a superman, some one who can do
my office work, attend family functions and a person like Gandhi who lives for
others than myself. Months ago my refusal to attend a family function led to
a torrent of blames and politics. People simply fail to grasp its not wise to
attend a function 100’s of kilometers away that too on an inconvenient time.
My request to attend function on another day at a good time that suits me was
rejected and I was villanized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly I don’t know what to do with these humans. They constantly need me to
boost up their image and wealth. They would trade my brand shamelessly for their gains. I
feel I am becoming more of a show piece, a piece of carbon thats been called a diamond
and sold for millions when I am just what I am. I am a man who loves to live in peace,
not any more, not any less.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I am consulting for a company now in Python web development.

your I.T company say that this is the Minimum Salary Paid (MSP) paid to you
rather than you are a Cost To The Company (CTC)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, why am I proposing this. Its simple. CTC is a degrading term. It means that 
you are costing that company, possibly not worth it. Well, that what it really means.
You are an liability rather than an asset. Customer brings in money and
magically it turns into profit, and you bite away those profits being an cost to
and rather not an asset to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies that truly care about people should not advertise that if you are
employed and it costs the company so much, saying that you cost a bite out of
their fortune, rather they must praise your worth. Companies must say that you
are worth so much, so this is the minimum salary that we can pay you. That means
at the end of working for that year your account will have that much amount
credited by the company. And that is a minimum amount. It can go up and not down.
This means that your minimum worth is so much and maximum is yet to be explored!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just conducted a poll on twitter and it wasn’t astonishing that most people
feel that the government wasn’t prepared for it. Whats astonishing for me was
22% felt that government was prepared for it! Thats a huge number infact. If
these are the people who are going to vote for AIADMK like fanatics, who knows
it would come to power once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another poll was about IT companies in Chennai. IT companies are worst managed
things. They are extremely inefficient piece of management, thats because we get
cheap labor in Chennai and hence they can be abused a lot. In fact slaves in
ancient Rome were able to work for just 6 hours and were able to get away and
they had 4 months of holiday! But we are forced to work so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the poll I conducted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Did your IT company in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/chennai?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#chennai&lt;/a&gt; made Saturday working because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChennaiRains2017?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#ChennaiRains2017&lt;/a&gt; ?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Karthikeyan A K (@karthik_ak) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/karthik_ak/status/926495453645901824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 3, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and not surprisingly looks like 50% of IT companies are inefficient and force
their employees to work on Saturday because of the rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is a food for thought, we the people of Chennai too pay taxes like
people in Tokyo:&lt;/p&gt;
