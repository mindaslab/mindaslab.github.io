&lt;p&gt;India is crippled by politicians, government servants inefficiency and corruption. We are so fed up with corruption that films like Indian, Anniyan, Ramana are superhero movies who fight and kill corrupt people. They were mega hits. In real life we knew if such a hero would exist, he wonâ€™t last long. There wonâ€™t be public support for him as there is public support for heroâ€™s in movies, and bad people will get him killed, or at least crippled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julian Assange exposed important facts about US military, he exposed how they killed the innocent. We all can see what happened to him. They booked that he raped women first, then I am not sure for what he is arrested for now, but we all know he is going to die in jail a very painful death. Almost none who shouted that one should have freedom of expression, not even US government which claims to spread democracy around the world would defend his freedom of sharing information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In India Savuku Shankar, a desh bakth, is doing the same. Sharing information what he has, and his opinions about his thought. In a democracy it should be allowed. But looks like he has shared his thoughts about a powerful religious leader who has direct connection to Modi and other higher ups. He is also sharing thoughts about evils of Hinduism, and itâ€™s caste system. He is against imposition of Sanskrit on Tamils. To make matters worst, he exposed corruption and durbar like practices in Tamilnadu police, and seems not be allied with any politician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now he shared a video where a journalist met a high police guy in a coffee shop. Letâ€™s say I goto coffee shop, tape someone, and release it on the internet. A coffee shop is a public place, people who attend it should know it. The journalist has got offended and put a case against him. That journalist also seems to hold some kind of hate and grudge against Savuku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a right wing, pro-Hindu Tamil media channel (that will never face the fate of Karuppar Kuutam), that channel seems to be getting very desperate on Savukkuâ€™s activities and slinging mud on him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also some order copy of court I saw which included tweets what Savukku shared. For some reason we call ourselves democracy, but if one shares cartoons on how bad India is, a so-called democratic India doesnâ€™t seem to tolerate it. For example, long back cartoons against corruption was shut down? Why? I donâ€™t know. Corruption in India however never seems to be shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish all the best for truth, and I hope it would triumph, but truth triumphing in India is very low.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How ancient Greek knew the circumference of the Earth</title><link href="/2022/07/24/how-ancient-greek-knew-the-circumference-of-the-earth.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How ancient Greek knew the circumference of the Earth" /><published>2022-07-24T14:44:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-07-24T14:44:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/07/24/how-ancient-greek-knew-the-circumference-of-the-earth</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/07/24/how-ancient-greek-knew-the-circumference-of-the-earth.html">&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;

     &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I couldnâ€™t help noticing is the number of white skinned people appearing in the movie. I think this story is set to take place kind of at least 1500 years ago, before India was discovered by Vascodagama, I wonder how there are so many white people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time we did have healthy trade with Europe, and mostly white skinned women were especially European entertainers and prostitutes. Except for Parthiban and others, most seems to have Aryan tone and goes as white as European ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May be this film is not a historically accurate one. May be Ponniyin Selvan novel itself wasnâ€™t thought out well. Or may be in ancient Chola courts they looked at skin color and banished dark toned Tamil people (especially women) and wanted to have only light toned entertainers from Europe and Aryans.

For me food is everything, so we need to have biriyani. We ventured into a place called Madras Bhai Biriyani. When we enetered the smell was good, and there was a muslim serving biriyani. When queried he said there was hydrabadi biriyani and vaniyambadi biriyani. I went for hydrabadi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully this hydrabai was not like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7Y80xABY9A0?clip=Ugkx3G-vKny6xFSxHEyK2n20U-6z9sx4Ut4l&amp;amp;clipt=EJVZGPbsAQ&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like hydrabadiâ€™s like to get the feel of 5-star hotels while eating biriyani. In 5-star hotel if you order coffee, you get milk, decoction, sugar, and you must mix them and make your own coffee. Similarly when you order hydrabadi biriyani, you will get rice, masala and meat pieces which you must mix. Itâ€™s a kind of way we Tamils hate. I was expecting biiyani to be like that, but it was given to me well mixed in Tamil way. I was thankful for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The taste was okay, the brinjal gravy was excellent, actually without the gravy of brinjal the biriyani was not so good. One thing that irked me was, when you pressed the chicken piece, something watery came out. I am not here to make judgement or demonize that place, but there was a heavy feeling after eating the biriyani, apart from that I did not face any health condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my verdict on Madras Bhai Biriyani is: not so good. If you are using old Chicken, please donâ€™t do stuff like that. Itâ€™s bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;they-might-cheat&quot;&gt;They might cheat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend and his wife are vegetarians. This Madras Bhai Biriyani and other shops share the eating spot, so they ordered vegetable fried rice, the server brought them egg fried rice, when they spotted the egg which was obvious and all over the rice, that guy said it was paneer. What? Thatâ€™s a lie, lie lie liar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So biriyani is not so good, neighboring shop cheats. Not a good place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;butterscotch&quot;&gt;Butterscotch?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that same place there was an ice cream shop, I ordered butterscotch, what I got was something like vanilla mixed with some stuff, and it was given in a waffle whose dimension was like a small tea cup, and for that they charged Rs 100/- . i couldnâ€™t believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-word&quot;&gt;Final word&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They might be using old products&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are not accurate, do wrong things and tell lies so that it will be covered&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Their rates are high&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Indian girl seems to have done a movie, and for the poster she has put an image in which goddess Kaali smokes. It would be shocking for any Hindu, as I was a Hindu too and am still a Hindu in my birth certificate, but I feel strongly that as a people of democracy we must tolerate any thought about our Gods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Hinduism, we donâ€™t depict Godâ€™s as good beings, take for example Indiran, the way Pillar got his mango, lord Raman killing Vaali, those were not good acts. Neither Hinduism claims Asuras are bad. Keralite worship Mahabali who is a good Asuran, there is reason why they say Raavanan is head of 10 good deeds and none can match him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this same Gods who have done good and evil are worshiped. One may say Kaali smoking is bad, okay then can someone ask why? We here in south worship Karuppan and Muneeswaran, Gods that smoke and drink. just because they are male Gods smoking still makes them good power, but just being a woman a smoking Kaali becomes a bad thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel very sorry for Indians, rather than giving a good rule for the people where people can afford fuel, cooking gas, vegetables, meat and real estate, Indian government people as though they have met goddess Kaali, and as though having got instructions from her to take down this poster, they have protested against Canada to ban this film or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common we are not stupid Arabs to take a myth serious enough to waste our diplomatâ€™s time like this. India was a mature democracy, now all it can do is to boast ho great it is, say to the world itâ€™s the protector of Hinduism, while the living standards of Indians goes down unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The problem of being a good Ruby on Rails developer</title><link href="/2022/07/06/the-problem-of-being-a-good-ruby-on-rails-developer.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The problem of being a good Ruby on Rails developer" /><published>2022-07-06T00:33:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-07-06T00:33:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/07/06/the-problem-of-being-a-good-ruby-on-rails-developer</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/07/06/the-problem-of-being-a-good-ruby-on-rails-developer.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Ruby_On_Rails_Logo.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason I listen to keynote speech of Matz, DHH, and Aaron Patterson. I feel what they talk makes sense to me, that too Matz future ideas about programming, and how computers should serve humans and not the other way around, DHHâ€™s idea of making Ruby on Rails so powerful that individual persons can challenge a big corporate employing tens of people coding a web app. these are powerful ideas. Aaron Pattersonâ€™s work of making Ruby as well as Rails faster and better. These all makes sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also felt what decisions what were made to Rails were very sensible except these two:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting rid of Coffeescript.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using Webpacker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still donâ€™t get what webpacker is. Thanks to Rails 7 we have got rid of it. I am coding in Rails since it was 2.x and it has given me a excellent experience. Even today if I touch legacy code of my former teams, I can understand the code and make changes in an easy way. As far as I know, none who has inherited code from me has reported a problem to me. The reason for that is very simple, Rails follows a convention, and I follow it religiously. Rails is a philosophy which has many best practices, and I stick to it. This however does not mean that changing double quotes to single quotes because shitty Rubocop yells at you. Doing such things is stupid. But I have to admit in project dominated by fools, I did follow Rubocop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then what happens when you are a good, stick to the principle Ruby on Rails developer. For example what will happen if you are a honest India government servant? You wonâ€™t take bribes, and you will find t too difficult to fit in India. So what will happen to a Ruby on Rails developer when he is in a project that violates lot of rules laid by Ruby on Rails. It becomes difficult for you, making modifications to it becomes a pain. You start to wonder why people picked up Ruby on Rails if they donâ€™t want to follow it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get experienced, when you become Architect of tech, Principal Engineer just by your age (I have seen no intelligence increase in a architect compared to novice), people hire you not because they want you to maintain a good project or want to start a green field project, they hire you because they really screwed up with Rails and want some one with age and experience to solve it. Itâ€™s like telling a bank manager to work with thieves. Thieves knows crappy way of doing things, the bank manager however sees perfection in system, understands economics and donâ€™t want to loot because he understands economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; When I say bank, I donâ€™t means real banks of today which loot us, I mean a ideal bank and ideal bank manager in a dream world. Today a thief admits he loots us, a bank does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So being a person who does not mess up Rails framework because you are sane, you need to work with insane people who have truly messed it up. Thatâ€™s a great problem for a Ruby on Rails purist.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Task which will fail 99.99% of Tamilnaduâ€™s Electronic Engineers</title><link href="/2022/07/02/task-which-will-fail-99-percent-of-tamilnadus-electronic-engineers.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Task which will fail 99.99% of Tamilnadu&apos;s Electronic Engineers" /><published>2022-07-02T09:50:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-07-02T09:50:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/07/02/task-which-will-fail-99-percent-of-tamilnadus-electronic-engineers</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/07/02/task-which-will-fail-99-percent-of-tamilnadus-electronic-engineers.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Task:&lt;/strong&gt; Implement RTL NAND on PCB that operates on 5V power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
