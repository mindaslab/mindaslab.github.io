I ask “why?”. We know the history of these parties. In this blog I am going to say why you should not vote for any of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;promoting-killers&quot;&gt;Promoting Killers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BJP kills cow eaters and non Hindus, Congress killed Sikhs. Both parties promote the accused Narendra Modi and Kamalnath to higher ranks. These parties that have such a large gatherings can’t even find a single person who is true and untainted? That’s amazing!! and shows to their lack of strictness and lack of commitment. When families in our nation weep for their lost ones due to communal violence, all these parities could do is to promote the tainted up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not talking about these people winning in court. Even if they have won in court, all the parties should have done is revoke their suspension and kept them as a basic worker and no more than that. Its strange that Narendra Modi and Kamalnath are irreplaceable. Its shows that these parties are unable to find a better talent in this vast India which shows their inefficiency. Should we vote for such inefficient parties?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dynastic-politics&quot;&gt;Dynastic politics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both BJP and Congress are dynastic according to Scroll.in, in BJP 31% of its MP’s come from some form of hereditary, and in congress its 33%. Just because we all recognize Gandhi’s we tend to assume Congress is dynastic and BJP is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again these parties are inefficient in selecting people to lead it. Rather than screening the nation and hand picking people who are truly interested in national welfare, these parties settle for the familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we citizens too settle for the familiar rather than screening candidates in our constituency, we will make our nation just another BJP and Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;same-source-of-funding&quot;&gt;Same source of funding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the BJP and congress, if they win will get funded by very same businesses, and they will enact laws that will benefit few oligarchic rich and will ignore us. So whats the difference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scams&quot;&gt;Scams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both parties are scandalous. Just because BJP ruled for only few 10+ years, their looting are less compared to around 70+ years of looting’s of congress. If we extrapolate BJP , they are nothing but congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;zero&quot;&gt;Zero&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/this_guy_gets_it.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Prinyka Herself admits it, and BJP didn’t deny it. The truth comes out some how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;elect-some-one-new&quot;&gt;Elect some one new&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you blind? Look around and bring some one new. Lets see what the new person does.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Many people I interact with say that they are either going to vote for Congress or the BJP.

&lt;p&gt;In desperation to win votes, Rahul and Modi are coming up with lots of stuff, and they are funny. First lets look at Modi, the BJP tried to own counter strikes for Pulwama, they almost celebrated like they fed, brought up and trained Abinandhan. They created the Sardar statue, now I think its abandoned by its staff due to lack of pay. They are trying hard to bring back Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallaya back, even though these fugitives I think have contributed huge amounts to the BJP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Rahul drops a bombshell. He said families that receive less than Rs 6000/- per month will get a amount of Rs 6000 from government. Well, this is a impressive scheme, I am sure this idea never would have risen in brain dead Rahul’s mind, but rather in the mind of some intelligent guy in the Congress. But any way credit goes to Congress for thinking about this plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tough it looks impressive, we need to know how government is going to count the salary of a person who receives so less? These people operate by cash, you can’t really monitor them! How do we know that a congress worker cannot control accounts of a an entire very poor village thus he getting all this money and donating some parts of it to the party?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scheme is different than UBI. In UBI, theoretically all people receive a basic income. Lets say that your boss for some reason has turned sour on you, and your life under him has become hell, you want to quit, but what will you do for the next month? UBI might not offer you pay as high as your salary, but you know you have a basic pay to survive. Under UBI all citizens are equal, and all must get a basic pay and all subsidies must be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be happy if the Congress or any other party proposed the UBI of Rs 1000/- per Indian per month, and not some scheme targeting specific people for votes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ruby on Rails Developer needed in Chennai.</title><link href="/2019/02/27/ruby-on-rails-developer-needed-in-chennai.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ruby on Rails Developer needed in Chennai." /><published>2019-02-27T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-02-27T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/02/27/ruby-on-rails-developer-needed-in-chennai</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/02/27/ruby-on-rails-developer-needed-in-chennai.html">&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard stories about Trump, how much idiot he is. My friends say some of their American clients gets furious when name of Trump gets mentioned. Many in USA view it as a disgrace and depletion of intelligence to America for him to have got elected. Well, here in India we have been electing very stupid leaders in my state Tamilnadu. We Tamil’s are so idiot that we don’t even realize that we have been electing idiots for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any way this blog is about Trump. I was thrown back when Trump linked Socialism to lack of freedom in State of Union speech. Socialism has got nothing to do with lack of freedom or has got nothing to do with freedom. Socialism is nothing more than social living. Its like you teaching your kid share its lunch with a friend in class who has forgotten its lunch. Its that simple. You can see Socialism with mother who has lot of kids. A kid that faces challenge gets more attention, for example a new born child receives more attention than a kid that’s able to go to school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socialism can be forced or unforced. You helping your neighbor, or community is a unforced socialism, but say a class teacher forcing your kid to share its lunch with the one who has failed to bring it is a forced one. In a similar way capitalism can be forced and unforced. A free market is a free capitalism, but are we consulted before making economic laws, or are few business people consulted before a law in made in a capitalistic land? Aren’t the will of the super rich are forced upon us? Think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An economic model chosen by a community has got nothing to do with the sense of freedom. Sense of freedom is a relative term and its very hard to define. Its hilarious that a person who is controlling the most powerful nation on this planet cannot grasp it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Aadhar Mystery</title><link href="/2019/02/03/the-aadhar-mystery.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Aadhar Mystery" /><published>2019-02-03T18:15:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-02-03T18:15:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/02/03/the-aadhar-mystery</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/02/03/the-aadhar-mystery.html">&lt;audio controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;
