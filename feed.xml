&lt;p&gt;It was Chennai floods, the Taminnadu administration had failed, the Chief Minister Jayalalitha was no where to be seen. The last time any one saw her was when she named two white tiger cubs born in Wonderloo zoo. Then this woman Valarmathi appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/valarmathy_crying,jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was two things she did. First she sabotaged the the efforts of public helping public to come out of the floods. Its said that she and her goons trashed relief and people waiting at Chennai borders, next she went to the flooded zones and she cried, thus washing away her sins from the minds of people with her tears and emotions. The next election, the party that failed Chennai people in the floods still won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-criminal-leader&quot;&gt;The criminal leader&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.financialexpress.com/2016/10/Jayalalithaa-PTI-L-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everywhere you go in Tamilnadu, you can see the pictures of Jayalalitha. The truth is, Jaya is a criminal who has been found guilty. Yet the ruling AIADMK is able to use her image to get traction in state. They have given hard earned taxpayers money to their party workers as presents like grinders, blender, television sets. They cleaverly disguised them as presents, thus winning emotional support from the people of this state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;law-fails-before-blind-faith&quot;&gt;Law fails before blind faith&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0ahClFGH4bw/TmYsfvuXvFI/AAAAAAAAAmM/Nsj6d7WHM3Y/s1600/swami-ayyappan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, two woman who tried to enter Aiyappan temple in Sabarimalai were blocked by blind faithers. In  a nation that says all Humans are equal, these people are successfully holding onto a system which gives preference to certain human over others depending upon their gender and who their parents are. Neither the Kerala government or any other political party said a word against these emotional religious extremist for the want of votes in coming elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-train-driver&quot;&gt;The train driver&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;316&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sX8QMTMqU9E?color=white&amp;amp;theme=light&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday evening, a mob watching Ram leela festival were standing on two tracks while the law of the land says tracks should be used for only brief moments, just to cross it and one must be super cautious about it as there is a chance that you will get over run by train. Two trains on schedule bashed and killed more than 50 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite knowing the law, the people became emotional saying that the train times should be altered and some how the trains should have magically slowed down. That’s rubbish. Yet none have the courage to say that these 100 or so people were idiots. Neither did their own lord Ram came to their rescue seeing their stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now think about the train drivers fate. He might be a logical and a good citizen, now he has got headache just because he is living in a nation where majority cannot think and act logically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-train-deaths&quot;&gt;More train deaths&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a button on a switch that leads a fast train to two tracks, one is a track that’s been in use but 50 children are playing in it ignoring reality, other one is a decommissioned and there is a clear marking its a decommissioned one and two children are playing in it knowing that’s its safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the train is unable to brake, which track would you choose? The one with 50 idiots or one with 2 wise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;emotional-national&quot;&gt;Emotional National&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all humans. We are guided by ancient behavior that’s been in our blood for millions of years. These things lead us to think emotionally. Today we have sexual education that’s been widely implemented in all schools, why don’t we have a emotional education program? In fact India is one of the first nations to have emotional education. There was a person called Buddha doing it, we have forgotten him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sexual feeling will be mostly for 30 years years in our life, but emotions will stay till our death. There must be a program in our schools to look beyond emotions and look at logic, to understand how our environment works, and to think of the best ways to improve and change it for the betterment of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well-being of nation consists of empowering the wise people and making the unwise wise. If our nation fails, it won’t be just us, like the United States we will be pulling humanity to abyss.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Winning election with tears</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Sabarimalai</title><link href="/2018/10/17/sabarimalai.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sabarimalai" /><published>2018-10-17T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-10-17T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2018/10/17/sabarimalai</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2018/10/17/sabarimalai.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Sabarimala2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, funny things are happening in India. A god called Aiyappan is treated like a men’s toilet. This god should not be worshiped or seen by women says Hindusism, but women do love to see Gods. In a judgment given by the apex court, women were allowed into the temple. Now some hindu fanatics acting against this judgment are blocking women  from entering this temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;women-can-enter-other-aiyappan-temples&quot;&gt;Women can enter other Aiyappan temples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whats really confusing to me is women can enter other Aiyappan temples. There are several temples of this God here in my city Chennai and I have seen women entering it and praying it. So isn’t Aiyappan in Chennai something greater and more powerful than men’s toilet in Sabarimalai?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;girl-animals-are-in-sabarimalai&quot;&gt;Girl animals are in Sabarimalai&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sabarimalai is surrounded by forests, and it has girl animals in it. These animals menstruate like human women and they must have wondered on the porch or even come close to Aiyappan there. If girl animals can do it, why can’t girl humans do it? We are part of the same kingdom. I am sure a girl bird would have once flown over aiyappans house and put its dropping on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think human girls would do such a disgusting thing because they have more intelligence, so why can’t they be allowed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sabarimalai-is-a-sham&quot;&gt;Sabarimalai is a sham&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One should note that Sabarimalai and Aiyappan is a sham. The Hindu has prove that makarajothi, a event where Aiyappan appears before humans is not a divine but a man made event. Aiyappan is just a cult, unlike a mortal Saibaba, Nithyananda, we just have a cult revolving around a statue, and statues last long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-feelings&quot;&gt;The feelings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people claim that feelings of believers are hurt by women entering this temple, but the same people say triple talaq system of divorce by muslim is wrong, and they too say that Saudi banning women from driving is wrong too. Aren’t they hurting muslim feelings then? Do they mean to say muslim feelings can be hurt wheras Hindus cannot? Or do they mean to say Indian and Saudi laws should change to empower only muslim women and not Hindu women?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-cant-aiyappan-handle-women&quot;&gt;Why can’t Aiyappan handle women?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why can’t Aiyappan handle women? Whats wrong with him? Is he a gay and don’t like women? Or is he a pervert who would jump out from his idol and have a fuck with a beautiful girl once he sees her?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-cant-law-reverse&quot;&gt;Why can’t law reverse?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a difference between facts and beliefs. Facts can be proven time and again and thus they can be verified, beliefs can and cannot be facts. Most religious beliefs aren’t facts and hence breaks down. Any progressive society will naturally weed out unwanted beliefs and will become a society that runs on facts so that it can become efficient and competitive and that’s what is happening to India. For India to go back to vedic times where women can be oppressed like animals, we need a revolution and Taliban like force occupying the power here. The RSS is one such organization that has a huge potential and they are in power. So women oppressors should support them so that women’s rights could be silenced one day. Till they the day they can oust democracy, you retards cannot do a thing in India.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why religion is stuck?</title><link href="/2018/10/13/why-religion-is-stuck.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why religion is stuck?" /><published>2018-10-13T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-10-13T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2018/10/13/why-religion-is-stuck</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2018/10/13/why-religion-is-stuck.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/A_Hindu_princess_committing_suttee_against_the_wishes_of_the_Wellcome_L0022809.jpg/800px-A_Hindu_princess_committing_suttee_against_the_wishes_of_the_Wellcome_L0022809.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictured above: the Hindu act of Sati, where it was believed that the woman should be burned along with the husbands pyre so that she could serve him in his afterlife.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a funny thing, one would worship the almighty God, and when something happens to his or health, the person would go to a doctor who follows scientific ways. Buddha once said “Nothing is constant. Everything is meaningless”. Though this is even ignored even by buddhists, this kind of thought never erupted in any other religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many religions was born out of thought, philosophy. How would you explain our existence? What happens to us when we are no more? Not having proper scientific thought and tools, they said or to be precise they blabbered what ever came to their mind and passed it down the generations. They thought what they thought was final and hence built an inflexibility into the system. This inflexibility would prove a moral death blow to religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the bible says we all came from Adam and Eve, and we lived in a garden and fell to earth possibly without parachutes. And the bible is projected as the ultimate truth. Now we know its bull shit. But Christianity, Islam and other Abrahamic religions are not willing to ditch these stories. This inflexibility, inability to recognize faults in the system and throw away the old and embrace the new trend is causing doom to religions. And today no sane mind believes truly in God, or any religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science on the other hand operates in other way. You can put what ever beautiful theories you want, but if it does not agree with reality its thrown out. This ability to provide practical theories to mankind, thus enabling him to understand about himself and his environment has made science thrive. Religious people are too egoistic and adamant to accept truth or ask sorry for misleading humans into a wrong path.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I Love Ruby’s new avatar</title><link href="/2018/10/12/i-love-ruby-s-new-avatar.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I Love Ruby's new avatar" /><published>2018-10-12T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-10-12T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2018/10/12/i-love-ruby-s-new-avatar</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2018/10/12/i-love-ruby-s-new-avatar.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i-love-ruby.gitlab.io/images/cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t imagine that I have been writing this book for 10+ years. I Love Ruby is getting a new avatar, its been ported from &lt;a href=&quot;https://mindaslab.github.io/I-Love-Ruby/&quot;&gt;https://mindaslab.github.io/I-Love-Ruby/&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://i-love-ruby.gitlab.io/&quot;&gt;https://i-love-ruby.gitlab.io/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some one long long ago told me about Asciidoctor, I did not consider it much then, then it became evident to me that people love to read from mobiles now than PDF, so I started to port this book. Though I am Data Scientist now, and am using Python for it, Ruby is my love and I can’t forget it. It was sad for me to hear Matz say that Ruby isn’t cool any more, I would rather say Ruby isn’t used in cool ways anymore. Its the greatest programming language I have seen, it suits to my personal needs than any other. I never thought I would see a language better than Perl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this port, even though I don’t find much time, is quite ambitious. First more than 250 pages must be ported, its a lot of work. I was planning to write a book called Solid Ruby which would talk to people about design patterns in Ruby, I have decided to scrap it and bring it under I Love Ruby thus making my life far simpler. I also wish to throw in some sample ruby projects in this book, and I wish to put out video tutorials. Since this book uses Asciidoctor, I dream of producing good quality epub and pdf, well, its quiet out of my hands though as I am not a contributor but a mere spectator to Asciidoctor. I wish to receive lot of feedback’s, they are really important as they give motivation or a chance to improve my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I port this book, I am re-reading it and finding many places to correct it, and they are been applied then and there. This book as always is a continually improving book, possibly bit more professional now that it was released 10 or 12 years ago. I also thank my company Trumatics for sponsoring it, well it was easy to get it as I am one of the partner :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be reporting the progress now and then in a sporadic way. Thanks for reading and happy coding.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Misinformation</title><link href="/2018/10/04/misinformation.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Misinformation" /><published>2018-10-04T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-10-04T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2018/10/04/misinformation</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2018/10/04/misinformation.html">&lt;p&gt;I was on a bike, my friend was driving it and he said that in November the Sun won’t be shining for 15 days, and this was confirmed by NASA said he.

&lt;p&gt;Another friend of mine some day said that in next two weeks there will be so much rain in Tamilnadu that it will become like Kerala. Well, there is rain now in Chennai as I type and the power is cut and I can’t work without the internet and I had to write this blog to pass my time. But its certainly not like that one in Kerala. But in Tamilnadu, infra is so weak that even a drizzle can put the state and its capital Chennai into tail spin. The government we have simply doesn’t know what to do. We don’t even implement rain proof infrastructure, if we do, then rains will have no effect and disaster measure wouldn’t be needed and hence corrupt P.W.D contractors won’t be able to loot our tax money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What baffles me is this misinformation, how it spreads and how people believe it and tell to others, like it was the truth even without verifying the facts. I asked my friend on bike “how do you think we will survive for 15 days without the sun?”, “we can use electrical lights” said he. So so dumb. Its not just light that sun gives us, its the heat. The sun puts out so much heat that almost all water on earth is liquid. Switch it off for two days and almost all seas will go to near freezing or would have been frozen. Water inside our cells would freeze and we will all die a gory death. And how would you reckon that a nuclear reactor so big as the sun could be shut down for 15 days and then be restarted?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder whats happening to people? They said world will end in C.E 2000, then in C.E 2012 and now this. You can say things, but it must be backed by sane thought and proofs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I was on a bike, my friend was driving it and he said that in November the Sun won’t be shining for 15 days, and this was confirmed by NASA said he.

&lt;p&gt;There is a Yogi in India who is called as Ramdev. He is advocate of how things Indian are superior to those of the west. He portrays himself as the savior of Indians from western influence and products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He promotes yoga and has got a product line called Patanjali which produces FMCG products so that Indian’s don’t buy western brands. All good, but what happens when Ramdev falls sick? Even though he calls himself a Yogi and promotes Indian stuff, when there is a real  issue with his health, he runs abroad for treatment says gossip. What a shame on him!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its not just him, late M.G.Ramachandran, an actor and ex-chief-minister of Tamilnadu had a famous song line in one of his movies that say “Whats not there in this divine nation (India), why should we stretch our hands to foreign nations?”. Yet when he had a major illness with his Kidney what did he do? He ran to USA to get a treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can only pity the people of India, how stupid they are and how they start to believe people who are in lime light so easy, and how they forget and forgive what the famous say and give in to sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that another leader in India, C.N.Annadurai was critical of Tamils ignorance. He never boasted about Indian superiority over the West, at the same time he never said the West are superior to us. He acknowledged reality that West was highly developed compared to us and advocated close partnership. He got treatment for his cancer from USA and that’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annadurai once said, when asked a Tamilian “whats the capital of USA?”, a Tamil would not know the answer, but when asked “whats the vehicle of Yamadharamn?”, “its buffalo” a Tamil would say without hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its quiet strange what has been happening in Hinduism for centuries. Like many cultures around the world, here in India, women are deprived of many rights, though they are slowly getting it back. I am happy that the supreme court has given a verdict that women can go into Iyappan temple. For centuries women have been kept out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason the God Iyappa there seems not to like women who are menstruating for some reason. No wonder he was born in an era that was relatively unscientific compared to what it is today and possibly menstruation was considered a taboo. Today in the age of science we know that’s not the case and its a natural process. So women are not less to men because they menstruate and hence they can be allowed in the temple says the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But still Hinduism seems strange to me. Pilliyar and Hanumaan are are both unmarried and symbolized bhramachariyam (the art of not getting intoxicated and seduced by women), yet its not bad for women to worship them, go to their temples, touch their pictures and idols. Its only in Iyappan temple we see all these fuss. That’s strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the court has given equal rights to women, I wonder what is going to happen next. We have the fanatic RSS which is supported by the ruling BJP, and many ordinary Hindus do not welcome this verdict. Will families send their women of age to Iyappan temple? None knows. Even if women of age do go to the temple, will they be safe? Wont the fanatics try to harass them, some cases insult and kill them? No one knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day Indian public will be mature. They will look upon women been banned from going to Iyappan as idiotic as women been forced to commit sathi, but till the mentality changes anything tragic fueled by Hindu fanatics could happen. That too today these fanatics are immune to law and order.

&lt;p&gt;There is a new law coming in India that says VIP’s must need a separate passage way in toll passes. That is the people who are our servants want to rush ahead of us rather than waiting behind our ass, or in other words VIP’s want us to sniff their ass and follow them. Fuck. How dare they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a country is equal, then why we need to have a divide of VIP’s and non VIP’s. Imagine thousands of vehicles standing in a jam, and one lane on either side of toll pass just been kept free for these shitty VIP’s. I just can’t digest it. I pay so much taxes and those bastards who live on my money want to have a better and special treatment which I am not entitled to. Fuck them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a country am I living in? People who loot me are able to enjoy better than me. People should think, think about what we have done to ourselves in the name of democracy. Here a ruling in High Court is passed in which we have a new caste system that’s been developed in which the upper most caste is VVIP’, VIP’s, Rich, and then we are shudras, the working class who do all the work but are entitled to sniff their shit and nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

These were the states that denied water to my state Tamilnadu for political and other reasons, and politicians in my state too took advantage of it to  increase their propaganda and get attention. The truth is, though we cannot completely avoid floods, we can minimize it by distributing water surplus to throughout India with careful planning and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As floods ravage many parts of our nation, we still have huge deserts in the North which when irrigated could produce food and support lot of livestock. Imagine the price of meat today in or nation, it has sky rocketed leaving many poor to be vegetarians.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Thar_desert_Rajasthan_India.jpg/1024px-Thar_desert_Rajasthan_India.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thar Desert India&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact the Chinese are converting their deserts to green paradise and are shrinking desert size, this achievement has never been done by any country&lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of achievement is possible in India too, if we can distribute water throughout the nation with pipes and motors we can achieve this. Pumping water costs energy, how can we find energy in an energy starved nation like us? The answer is solar and wind, India is a sunlight surplus nation, we also lot of shoreline that means we can harness wind energy, now offshore wind is becoming big and its costs are dropping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;316&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PUlfvXaISvc?color=white&amp;amp;theme=light&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can let homes apply for 0% loans to install solar on their roof tops, connect it to national grid, then we can make electricity extremely cheap. When there is excess electricity we can use it for pumping water from one place to another thus leveling out floods and water surplus.&lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a million kilometers of pipe with 2 meters in diameter, they can store 2 trillion liters of water, this mega pipeline that crisscrosses the nation will add a network storage effort. On such a large scale this grand Indian pipeline will become like the railways, it needs many managers, engineers , laborers to keep it working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This freshwater network could also serve as a energy storage solution. When there is huge amount of fresh water we can use pumped hydro to store excess energy that’s been generated by our electricity grid and salinity gradient to generate energy in coastal regions.&lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More canals, dykes and dams would mean more aquaculture. We all know how much fish and sea food costs now, this project could bring it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are all these possible in a corrupt and bureaucratic country like India? I don’t know. Technically its possible, as an Engineer I can guarantee it. But there are water surplus states in India who would like to let their water waste to sea than to give it to their neighbors. They have been blocking such a scheme for long.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Its flood in Kerala, tens are dying in it, Karnataka too is receiving a huge rainfall.

I used Rails 5.2 and hence active storage. I did refer its documentation and resized the image as stated in 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html#transforming-images&quot;&gt;http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html#transforming-images&lt;/a&gt; , and to my dismay I got this error message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;MiniMagick::Error &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;mogrify &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-resize-to-fit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;100, 100] /tmp/mini_magick20180623-27536-w8k32h.jpg&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; failed with error:
mogrify-im6.q16: unrecognized option &lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-resize-to-fit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;' @ error/mogrify.c/MogrifyImageCommand/5885.
):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So reading the error I was able to figure out &lt;em&gt;resize_to_fit&lt;/em&gt; was not the thing that must be used, so I checked on the internet and found that &lt;em&gt;resize&lt;/em&gt; works, and one rather than giving:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%= image_tag user.avatar.variant(resize_to_fit: [100, 100]) %&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;can get away by modifying it as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%= image_tag user.avatar.variant(resize: &quot;100 x100&quot;) %&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did any one of you face such an issue? Is there a mistake in Rails docs? I don’t know. But it definitely did not work for me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I was coding for a project where image needs to uploaded and resized.
