The Readdy in his name is a caste name, a sign that says what is his status amongst other humans in India is. India claims it’s a country of equals, but those who say they uphold these values, and seek to rule people, shamelessly put their caste name in their name. They aren’t a bit ashamed of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take my state Tamilnadu, I have no clue what caste M.K.Stalin is, people in his family have married people of different castes, and possibly married people of different states. I am proud of my chief minister, and I am proud about his dad Karunanidhi to have pushed caste aside and put people front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our state BJP leader Annamalai is falling at the feet of some guy just because Annamalai thinks he belongs to a lower caste than a Brahmin (to whom he is falling to). So he willingly subjugates himself. Look at the eyes of those little boys, feeling so uncomfortable when a elderly man falls almost onto their feet, these boys will be trained to accept it, they will be told that god favors them and not the majority of the people in India who think and work. Those boys will be trained to live like lords because they are brahmins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These boys will grow up and train their kids saying that they are superior Aryan race and others in India are inferior to them. It’s this kind of blind faith BJP and RSS wants to cultivate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should think. Are we Tamils here to watch these humans subjugating humans for no reason, or are we here to put rational thought into the brains of Indians and make our country developed and equal to all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a wow to destroy BJP, RSS, Muslim League, Khalistan, or what ever that keeps humanity in the dark by spreading blind faith.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Let’s take chief minister of Andhrapradesh, his name is Y.S.Rajashekkar Readdy.

Just a day or two ago I went to eat pani poori, and today I found that the potato masala kept for pani poori was infested with flies, flies were everywhere in hotel. I couldn’t find a fly catcher there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Sithalapakkam, all hotels and food shop has flies thanks to cow dung and dog shit on roads. Nobody cares to clean it, nobody cares to prevent it, for some reason Tamils I find seems to love shit and love flies that sit on them to sit on their food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out leaders Stalin and Modi will talk about achieving 1 trillion and 5 trillion economy, but are incapable of scrapping of dog and cow shit from roads. It’s this kind of leaders we have elected. Now think about our intelligence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our state leader thinks that he must be CM, because his dad was a CM, I am sure he feels his son and grandson should be CM too. There are a bunch of people who cal themselves DMK who have no brains and back this kind of family politics. The result, our CM can’t even scrap dung from roads. He is incapable for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our national scene is even worst, he is a genocide specialist who thinks he must rule India because he knows Sanskrit, and licks brahmins feet etc. He thinks demonetization will kill off terrorism and black money, ignores scams made by his friends companies, and is incapable of keeping my areas street free of dung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, are we intelligent enough to elect at least a dung scrapper from now on?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Today I stepped into Sai food court in Sithalapakkam and was surprised to find a stray dog in there.

I did not read the resume, and so I read it, it looked perfect to me, in further calls it looked like my friend was expecting a CV and not resume.

I wish HR’s are familiar what’s the difference, else it would be really laughable.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I saw news that a DMK speaker was removed because he told some remark about Kushboo, and Kushboo gave a crying interview before the press saying how she felt hurt by the derogatory remark and how she wanted to slap the DMK worker with her slippers, but felt that her slipper will get morally dirty by slapping him. After this emotional interview DMK removed that stage speaker Sivaji Krishnamurthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now DMK has sent a message to BJP, if women’s rights are stepped upon, then DMK will act upon it. Or may be DMK people love cinema people and want to be associated with them, who knows? I am saying this because Udhayanidhi Stalin went on a hunger strike because Nayantara refused to act with him. May be her policy is to act with actors (that is people who can act), so unable to get associated with her, Udhayanidhi went to extreme measure. May be DMK still wants to please Kushboo. Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Kushboo is in a tight spot, if her rights are violated, then she puts up all scene, but if women wrestlers of India are molested by a BJP guy Brij Bhushan, Kushboo is almost mute. She won’t cry for them, she won’t call a press meet, she won’t put a sentimental show to get that guy out, her slippers will be under her feet, and she won’t feel like slapping him with it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s raining in Chennai, I woke up to and found in News that Chennai is not flooded, it wwas a shock to me. Last year Mayor Priya told us to excuse the DMK, and this year there will be no floods, I couldn’t believe that DMK did what they promised. I was shell shocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the truth set it, I was watching Sun TV a DMK channel. I switched to other channels and found that Santhome, lot of subways are flooded. I don’t think Chennai corporation has produced any official briefing that it’s better to avoid traveling in these routes and these routes are clear. Looks like the corporation still hasn’t woken up to the fact that Chennai is under rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my place Sithalapakkam, the place where I live Skylab Avenue has no metalled roads, even on sunny days we get a bumpy ride, water gets puddled up here and there during rains. Governments that claim that they care about people, still seem not to recognize we are people.&lt;/p&gt;

A great astrologer once told me that I will start believing in God by age 27, I’m 40 now and wonder how nonexistent God is going to pop out of nowhere and make me believe in it. When I do ask questions about astrology, my friends who believe it and even some astrologers get furious, I don’t get why. Just for sun, when friends come to me with problems, I do ask them what did the astrologers say, they get really serious and say something, and I laugh inside seeing their ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I knew psychology, sometime some incidents seems to happen in batches, and they seem totally unrelated to each other, it looks like you are destined to receive it. Here are two of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, one of my relative bought a house in Bangalore, so he told the elders in my family that I should attend the housewarming, I did not want to travel in bus, it robs my sleep and next day would be somewhat, I never got a train ticket, and flight would be prohibitively expensive, so I said no, and thought that was the end of matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like that jerk got really pissed off because I said no, and he started to pull string, and gave 
me unnecessary problems. I saw good people turn evil, the guy causing the problem was comfortably hiding behind them like a coward, unable to confront me. People behaved like psychopaths with me. I was baffled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dealing with those psychopaths, I thought what could go wrong? And it did. I was working in a company called Trumatics, and something happened to my co-director. He started to shout, he started to shout at me and every one like psychopath. I even saw him shout at my friend, because he was angry that he could not blame me that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really started to wonder if fate had decided about me, (even though I had eliminated some psychopaths out of my life and was recovering,), if it wanted to be keep me encountering more psychos or something. In brief, I was wondering if there is some destiny or something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next incident happened recently, I was traveling in car with few people, the person sitting next to instructed me on every thing, he said which lane I should drive, when to put the indicator, when to brake and blah blah, I was frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week after that his son was sitting next to me, and he told me when to switch on the wiper, he asked me to pick up speed in densely packed road that was almost dead still in traffic. I thought, okay this is a son of a psycho and no wonder. I brushed it off, maybe it’s genetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very next day I was with a another friend whose company I am investing in, historically he was not like the father son psychos, a well tuned mind he was, he started say do this and that while I was driving. These three driving incidents happened within a span of week and few days, and I was wondering why am I encountering such a strange behavior of people in my car. I started to think about destiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though coincidence, very similar stuff happening at very short intervals looks spooky.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I don’t believe in astrology, even if you believe, it’s just a set of words that could or could not happen.

&lt;p&gt;If people of DMK and AIADMK hear such damaging truth, and don’t have facts and reasons to counter it, they must commit suicide if they have a bit of self dignity left in them. Guess what none would.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s great that the opposition parties which almost don’t have the spine to appose Modi are going to boycott the inauguration of new parliament building, the reason they chose to boycott will anger all true Hindu’s in this nation, and it should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opposition parties have a simple request, the leader of India Draupathi Murmu should inaugurate our parliament building, but why she is not invite and cannot inaugurate our parliament is hushed up, this speaks volumes about Hinduism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First our president is from lower caste, which Brahmin feet lickers won’t like, her caste people could be considered inauspicious beings by them. In fact, I think in ancient Hinduism our president’s caste could be a untouchable caste. According to hindu’s may be those caste people should do only tasks like disposing the dead, cleaning toilet’s, taking care of cattle, doing household chores etc. I think pure Hindu’s will even wash the things touched by lower caste people to purify it. So BJP and RSS might have been instructed by their Hind lords  not to invite a lower caste person to pollute our parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, she is a woman. India is a nation that still treats woman as slaves. Now we don’t publicly burn woman just because her husband is dead, but we do all other forms of mistreatment. Visit a house of an Aiyappan devotee and talk frank with the women in the home, and you will know, in fact one will be shocked to find out how women are still been treated as untouchables by their own dad’s, husbands and brothers even today during an Aiyappan season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women are meant to be slaves who do not have access to Gods. Vedas are banned for them, in ancient homes Sanskrit was not thought to them so that they don’t have access to Gods. The only purpose of woman in post Aryan invaded India is to be slave of men in family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can a woman who is impure according to the religion followed by BJP and RSS people can contaminate our pure Parliament? That too during it’s inauguration?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So according to a Hindu and Indian, people requesting that President should inaugurate parliament are anti-Indians and anti-national. I am proud to be one more anti-Indian during this time.&lt;/p&gt;

That too the kid in the I.T company if it’s in a tier 2 or tier 3 town, they an save a lot of money and settle for life soon, marry, and once that’s done, not even we can save it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now almost none of you in tech knows assembly language, soon no new hires might know programming languages. They will tell computers what to do, and the computer will spit the binary out. You need not worry about code craft, clean code and so on, just like you do not need to worry about garbage collection these days.

&lt;p&gt;Companies that can give the highest percapita A.I power to their employees will win. They will make money. Just like a company of 17 today is making more money than a company of untrained 350 programmers, a small company that has great minds and high percapita A.I power can make the money of a company that has 1000’s of people who are untrained in A.I and free thought.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I.T has given India a lot, one’s father might be a daily wage laborer, but child in the family might be very interested in computers, all the child has is a cell phone, the child calls a right company expresses interest, they test for the curiosity, laptop arrives to their home, along with broadband, within 4 years the kid has a car, a home on loan which can be paid off in another 3 years.</summary></entry></feed>
