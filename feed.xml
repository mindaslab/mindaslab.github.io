I must however say that their tiffin is good, or should I say okay enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I was in Bhavani and went to Taste 6 because my friends recommended it. Then my location was shifted to Pamba and Flavors and Platters was the nearest thing I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had purchased poori. In both Taste 6 and Flavors and Platters we get three poori’s. But here comes the difference, in taste 6 the poori looks larger and thinner, in flavors the poori looks bit small and I feel its more bulky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Taste 6 the poori when torn get crumbly and flakes off, in Falvors its not like that. Poori is a poori and you would feel the top layer of the poori is bit crunchy, the bottom layer is soft a nicely cooked. So Flavors wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Taste 6 we get a white coconut chutney, a spicy orange coconut chutney, and potato curry. But the quantity of side dish in Taste 6 is very small. In flavors we just get potato curry, and it tastes okayish to good sometimes, but they have a nice shallow side dish plate with a handle. In case you have a hot side dish that handle will help you and if the side dish is liquidy you can turn the plate into a huge ladel and pour it onto your main plate. Crockery of Flavors is exceptional compared to other restaurants in Technopark. This side dish plate is half filled with porato curry and its copious, that won my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ambiance of Flavors and Platters is good. The poori in Flavors costs Rs 50/- whereas in Taste 6 costs Rs 52/-. I wish Taste 6 either reduces their price or improves their quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I ate parota and Egg Masla in Flavours and it was good too. I loved the smell of burnt onions, some people outside India may not like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one sentence, Flavors is not for Briyani, but its good for tiffin.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In one of my blogs I had slammed flavors and platters for their briyani, and ya, briyani over there is pathetic.

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SomeClass&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;private_function&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# some stuff&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; 
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;public_function&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# some stuff&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if you do like that then the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;public_function&lt;/code&gt; defined below the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; key word is also a private! Duh!!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A remedy would be to do something like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SomeClass&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;private_function&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# some stuff&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; 
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; 
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;public_function&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# some stuff&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is as soon a private function(s) definition(s) ends you can call &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; thus making all functions that follow it public. But, though it’s right, it would be better to design an class like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ClassHowFunctionsCouldBePlaced&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# put all public functions here&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;public_function&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
   
  &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt;
   
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# put all protected functions here&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;protected_function&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# put all private functions here&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;private_function&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
   
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you put functions as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;class ClassHowFunctionsCouldBePlaced&lt;/code&gt; is defined, then you will have no  access problems or other access issues.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I find that some people are declaring private function at the top of class, like this</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Crap Briyani @ Flavours and Platters - Technopark Trivandrum</title><link href="/trivandrum/briyani/food/restaurant%20reviews/2020/03/03/crap-briyani-flavours-and-platters-technopark-trivandrum.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Crap Briyani @ Flavours and Platters - Technopark Trivandrum" /><published>2020-03-03T21:24:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-03-03T21:24:00+05:30</updated><id>/trivandrum/briyani/food/restaurant%20reviews/2020/03/03/crap-briyani-flavours-and-platters-technopark-trivandrum</id><content type="html" xml:base="/trivandrum/briyani/food/restaurant%20reviews/2020/03/03/crap-briyani-flavours-and-platters-technopark-trivandrum.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/flavours_and_platters.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are times when you are sick, you will be offered a awful tasting gruel prepared @ your home. Its tasteless and awful. You would wonder what wrong you had done to deserve such a fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine you are in a restaurant, ordered Briyani and you are offered something that tastes like that awful gruel, tasteless. Its like eating liquid styrofoam, that was my experience today in Flavours and platters in Technopark today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went there because one of my friends suggested it to me and he said it will be good. The first thing I found was this restaurant was kind of disorganized. A lady puts a bill for briyani and she keeps it to herself and tells me to goto a counter to collect it. I go to the counter and find a lady laying out a white rice kind of thing on plate, she asks me ‘are you here for briyani?’, I say ‘ya’ and she hands it over to me. I serve myself some pickle and raitha, and another person asks for Briyani, its then she realizes that this briyani is for him, and I hand my plate to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now she goes to the counter and asks if I did order a briyani, the lady at the counter says ‘ya’, this serving lady come back and accuses me (not in a offending way) of not giving the bill. Well the lady in counter would not give me the bill for some reason, all she said was go there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I get a serving of briyani (yak, thats not briyani, its actually white rice, two pieces of chicken meat and a boiled egg). Usually Kerala Briyani is not as good ad Hydrabadi, but it would have enough masala to mix into the rice and make it spicy. Here no, the masala was almost non existant. You just had white rice, boiled two pieces of chicken tossed into it along with an egg. All these stuff when sold for Rs 20/- might be okay, but they are charging it whoppy Rs 160/-. Thats an absolute waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend back at office told me that once Malabar briyani @ Flavours and Platters was good, but now I feel its truly crap.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My work @ Trivandrum</title><link href="/2020/03/01/my-work-trivandrum.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My work @ Trivandrum" /><published>2020-03-01T12:29:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-03-01T12:29:00+05:30</updated><id>/2020/03/01/my-work-trivandrum</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2020/03/01/my-work-trivandrum.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f0/Technopark_Trivandrum_Ariel_View_June_2014.jpg/1200px-Technopark_Trivandrum_Ariel_View_June_2014.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have never imagined I would work in Kerala. As a Chennai kid, for me Kerala is a place to go and get relaxed, where you can get a massage, live in boat house with food served by beautiful girl hostesses. I never imagined I would come here for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was given a good cop and bad cop treatment at a company called Francium before, I hated that treatment. The same was happening to many good minds there, then we were fired saying that they wasn’t enough money in the company, while juniors were told that we were fired because of lack of performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ill treatment of us, despite our professionalism, cut a deep wound in us, we were desperate to redeem, and out of many offers I got, I analyzed a lot. I must not get caught with another mad man or mad system once again I thought, the people of this company Guide House seem to have been behaving properly during interview and I chose it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got calls from Change Pond, a company near my home, and I think another company called VThink Global, just 5Km from my home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change Pond was pushy, they desperately want me in, they couldn’t control their desperation. They needed money from Ruby on Rails and a project was staring at them, they wanted me to negotiate with the client to bag the project. Well, I thought, these people don’t even have a RoR project and they want me. Let’s say a situation where the project doesn’t go well, they were denied payment by the client, don’t these people who are desperate for money pounce on me for not getting it? Possibly terminate me? So I said no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VTink Global had no professional leadership, (very much like Francium Tech) it could be seen under the sun. Since it was near my home, I wanted to work as part time and try out my other stuff, like setting up an non I.T business. I offered to work there for 25 hours a week, they negotiated a lot / look uncomfortable on rates, then all of a sudden they wanted me to work there for 40 hours a week. This instability of their thought, without proper reason given made me reject it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The H.R of Guide House behaved in professional way, the interview was done in professional way, the first round went about for 3 hours, I enjoyed talking to this girl Suma who was a technician too. Next I talked an hour with a guy called Suresh who was a director there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now one must not think Change Pond and VThink are evil and Guide House is holy, as with everything there is a mixture of all in everything. At that instance i was impressed by guide house. They did not change their mind, their talk was direct. I liked it. Unlike my previous company there seem to be no indication that they were hiding something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its like this, you know AIADMK and DMK are evil, so vote for Seeman or Vijaykanth. Does that make Seeman and Vijaykanth good or uncorrupt? No. When faced with madness, annoyance, loose talk and deception, I went with an unknown hoping it would be different if not better. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank the H.R department of Guide House. People like Neeraj and Neetu assisted me well. Plus my friend Honest Raj who reffered me. He has that fire that an engineer should have and Guide House should be fortunate to have him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have I stopped doing freelancing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell no. I am doing or should I say helping out people doing Data Science and Numerical Computing projects with Julia. My age old clients still pay money to keep their servers running. I have a bunch of friends in Chennai, Namakkal, Pondicherry who do Spark, Ruby on Rails and mobile app development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love tech and would like to talk to any one who wants to know how technology can improve their life and business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love freelancing, you can earn $40 an hour, get away with working 20 hours a week and have work life balance, but shouting out among many minnows and showing off to people aka marketing is difficult, so I have opted for a stable income as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus freelancing will have an enthusiastic client this week, next week the payment will be delayed and the next week you may not be able to contact him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Instant feedback for programmers</title><link href="/2020/02/20/instant-feedback-for-programmers.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Instant feedback for programmers" /><published>2020-02-20T14:07:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-02-20T14:07:00+05:30</updated><id>/2020/02/20/instant-feedback-for-programmers</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2020/02/20/instant-feedback-for-programmers.html">&lt;p&gt;As an architect, its not just enough if I look at the code architecture of a project, I have to architect the scaffolding too for creating a good programming environment. Take for instance a building site, even before building a structure you must have the site made. Water facility, toilets, and temporary shelters for the workers must be there, the site must be marked where to excavate, where a foundation must be laid and so on. It quite similar in software project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One good thing about construction is its visual, w can see if a brick is laid right or its jutting out visually. even slightest deviation of a straight wall construction can be found out with  a plumb line, a truly a miracle invention indeed! With code some errors might be there which are not visually identifiable. It may be easy to look or inspect a building, but to inspect code is not so intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So part of a building a great scaffolding for code is to set up reporting tools that report you visually about code quality and other things. This is how we had done code mostly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/project_structure_old.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer we would have pushed code to source code repository, this would have been staged and tested by tester and it would have been deployed to production if things are okay. There wasn’t much emphasis given to code quality and other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining code quality, and checking that the code this release did not break the code of last one was hard, and it was avoided and ignored until it was really necessary. Or we took the convenience of saying to us that we will do it in free time and that had never happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully we now  have tools to run our tests, so we can automate tests, see how our code adheres to programming best practices (code smells), we can see how much of our code is tested. So this is how our new way of coding should be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/project_structure.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when the developer pushes the code, these tools that do Testing, Code Smell Estimation and Test Coverage must pull the code and must do their job. Their output should be instantly available to the programmer as a very visual report, if all reports are okay, then we must go on for staging deploy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once staging deploy is done it is the job of manual tester to test it, if the manual tester is okay, then we must goto production deploy. In the production deploy we must gather as much performance metic as possible and the programmer an tweak his or her code to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all these are followed religiously then we have a good chance of creating a better software.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">As an architect, its not just enough if I look at the code architecture of a project, I have to architect the scaffolding too for creating a good programming environment.

&lt;p&gt;For people in Medavakkam, I have tasted almost all Briyani’s there. There are two restaurants that I feel competes with each other in terms of quantity of food. Those are A.R.Rehmaan (does not belong to the music director), and Salem.R.R. I feel Rehmaan wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s come to the cost. At my last purchase, Salem’s price is about Rs 210/- per briyani, and its quantity is sufficient for a guy like me to eat. For girls I think 2 people can eat it (I have always wondered why girls eat so so less, anyway),  Rehmaan gives 25% more of quantity for price Rs 270/- which steadily rose from Rs 210/-. I am against the price hike, but I feel Rehmaan gives good value for price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to taste Rehmaan gives a better tasting one, its more like Nawaabi Briyani which you can find it in few shops in Triplicane. The ratio of meat to rice is low. But the taste of Briyani, the taste of Brijal beats Salem straight on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Rehmaan can give its briyani for Rs 210/- Salem.R.R will be forced to improve it quality, but…. they are in no mood to think and reduce price and make competition to benefit the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you buy this briyani parcel from Rehmaan you must be careful, some times the mittai khanna is not there, some times its a brinjal or onions that goes missing. An annoyance in quality control when its packing, but still it wins. The 270/- is a double Briyani, some times even 3 people may be eat from it if one gives off meat. But meat quantity is low.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Where Periyaar Failed</title><link href="/2020/01/30/where-periyaar-failed.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Where Periyaar Failed" /><published>2020-01-30T10:14:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-01-30T10:14:00+05:30</updated><id>/2020/01/30/where-periyaar-failed</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2020/01/30/where-periyaar-failed.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.countercurrents.org/periyar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we hail him as a great reformer, we portray him as a very successful man. Almost no Tamil puts his caste name after his name, women in Tamilnadu are going to work, that was once considered taboo, Brahmins do  not eat meals aloof from other communities, they now behave like they are one among us (whereas in Pakistan mullahs advise the young not to have meals with Christians and Hindus). These are all seen as kind of victory for the Dravidian movement which was started by Periyaar. But there are lot of failures too. He avoided lot of subjects too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;did-not-attack-islam-and-christianity-as-much&quot;&gt;Did not attack Islam and Christianity as much&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Periyaar maintained that all who worshiped God are idiots and savages, he did not irk the ire of Muslims and Christians that much. They did not say a supportive word for his work because if they said it means they have denounced their religion, but they did not protest  as they would protest against Modi today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Periyaar fell into the convenience of jsut attacking his own religion Hinduism. Strategically that’s good, because in only large bodies of people you will find people of varied opinion, and to attack it means you can create divisions and split it, you will get internal support. But morally that’s weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lot of Muslim women who hate the restrictions of their religion. There are lot of Christians who say Jesus simply did not exist. We have no proof that Muhammad exists and Jesus if he did exist escaped crucifixion death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Periyaar could have attacked it, but yes at that time our investigative powers were not that much and we did not have the tools to debate about Christianity and Islam, but the base is wrong, both promote God, Satan and other supernatural powers which is utter bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Religion and caste still exist. We haven’t listened to our reformer, turned our religious houses to museums like Soviet Union did. We still believe God and other supernatural powers exist and by praying to them and making offerings and sacrifices our lives will be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still caste system exists in Tamilnadu. Being a Chennai guy, when I travel out of Chennai (not even 20Km awaay) I do see people speaking high about their caste and low about other castes. Believe it or not Tamil Christians and Muslims have injected caste into their respective religions. These religions were created to make all Humanity a single equal entity, but our people have bent these religion to their convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;sidha-hasnt-become-scientific-yet&quot;&gt;Sidha hasn’t become scientific yet&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://drmerish.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/cropped-ayurveda-utensils.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Periyaar did not go along with Sidha and other Indian medicine. The reason is simple, there was no proper scientific or statistical study on it. I know that jeeragam helps me to digest food, and its true, but none has said there is a statistical and scientific evidence for it. We just went by word of mouth, which is wrong. On the contrary we have alopathy where things are peer reviewed, scrutinized etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government of Tamilnadu has set up a Sidha research center, but I think its still under par with other international research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sivathanu Pillai’s (Bhramos Director) dad could cure cancer at last stages, a doctor called Parvathi (who’s potrait hangs in Sidha institute I hope) of my family could cure paralysis, a miracle by alopathy standard, yet all is lost after their death. Omitting Sidha was a protest by this man to make it scientific and a public knowledge, and still we are loosing a lot f knowledge and we don’t know whether we will rediscover it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;women-still-marry&quot;&gt;Women still marry&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://webneel.com/daily/sites/default/files/images/project/tansihq-wedding-photography-india-brid-groom%20(6).jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Periyaar was against marriage, though he himself got married twice. The second one was pure technical, to save his trust. But the truth is marriage makes women a slave. A slave who serves her husband, and becomes a child bearing machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all civilizations are like us where women are considered inferior, there is a region in China where women don’t marry. They stand equal to men. But this type of societal change, Periyaar was unable to bring about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-nation-that-still-recognizes-religion&quot;&gt;A nation that still recognizes religion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vaibhavahini.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/wpid-page-priyanka-elections-02-india-map-vector-460658387.jpg?w=1000&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though you goto court and say that God guided you to commit a crime, the court won’t believe it. It’s because court tries to be scientific as possible. But as a state, though our law’s don’t recognize religion, our nation is secular and religious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millions are spent on religious activity. Even our ISRO scientists pray god before rocket launch. Chinese scientist don’t pray to God, but they put more number of satellites than any other nation. They have far superior human space program, and a excellent program for a space station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nation and it law should be aloof of religion and caste, but ours recognizes religion even though there are no God’s and Satan’s around. Periyaar tried to change this, but how can one thinker win over 30 crore idiots?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;thankfully-no-drividastan&quot;&gt;Thankfully no Drividastan&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZmCHpeINjWw/maxresdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Jinnah divided India by creating Pakistan, Periyaar demanded Dravidastan. A separate Dravidian nation. I am very happy it did not happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that we were a separate nation and thugs like Karunanidhi, MGR and Jayalaitha ruled. When under the Indian union these people loot us like hell, imagine what they would have done if they were the most constitutionally superior power in Tamilnadu. We would have been  like an worst off like some African nations, riddled with corruption and poverty and even civil war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;no-scientific-tamil-yet&quot;&gt;No Scientific Tamil yet&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://parentedge.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Life-Sciences.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than we singing Tamil hymns and puranaas, and talking about beauty and antiquity of Tamil civilization, Periyaar rightly realized that you need to have Scientific literature translated into Tamil. He was very right that one could understand concepts better in the language of his native rather than a foreign language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we Tamils wanted quick money and have sacrificed our language to English. Any technical person in Tamilnadu is now forced to learn English to keep up with technology, whereas Chinese or Japanese technician can manage with their own language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This inferiority complex in Tamils, accepting Sanskrit as God’s language and letting Aryan culture in, accepting the English to rule us, accepting English to dominate our land rather than Tamil is still there, possibly it will end the era of Tamil among humanity as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Another Disturbing Fact About Trumatics</title><link href="/2020/01/22/another-disturbing-fact-about-trumatics.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Another Disturbing Fact About Trumatics" /><published>2020-01-22T17:30:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-01-22T17:30:00+05:30</updated><id>/2020/01/22/another-disturbing-fact-about-trumatics</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2020/01/22/another-disturbing-fact-about-trumatics.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://134.209.159.113/trumatics/img/Trumatics-border.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to Trumatics with passion, it was my own co-founded company. It was founded by a guy called Umashankar who I met in this company Zanec. All people who worked under him praised him. I thought I was with the right person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company started good, we had a project which we salvaged from Zanec and that was going on, we got in other assignments too. Every company enters a lean period, when we entered it rather than cutting operation cost, Umashankar claimed he was paying off employees by taking loans, a highly disturbing thing. I was advocating for lay off, getting in interns, lowering software production cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were into PHP, Ruby on Rails, Machine Learning with just few staff, not an easy feat, we did have good projects from other companies too, but some thing happened to Umashankar, he got mad often on us and shouted like hell. I couldn’t bear it and walked away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that was there in Trumatics is we had done lot of open source libraries and released it, after some time from my walk out it was gone all gone. But thankfully I had dusted my old laptop and some are there, I am trying to salvage it and put it out once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason a person who was non shitty in Zanec became a shitty monster, though he had major stake in Trumatics, a software firm, he had yanked those libraries or at the least made them hidden from the eyes of the outside world. It’s like GNU/Linux selling itself to Microsoft. A very bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I feel somewhat that we have split, I also feel happy that I have walked away from a group that does not know the value of free software[^1]. Without free software, software would be so costly, I wouldn’t be blogging this stuff and even though if I managed to do it being insanely rich, you wouldn’t have the money to read it. That’s the difference free software has made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason people who create companies seem to be aloof from these basic software ethics and they tend to treat people badly and behave as though they are superhuman beings and employees under them are cattle that can be abused and slaughtered any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Ruby 2.7 is there and its fast. This very blog is powered by Jekyll and Ruby 2.7 and I can see its speed. I am happy about it, you too will be happy about it if you aren’t worried about this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/home/ak/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.7.0/gems/activerecord-6.0.2.1/lib/active_record/persistence.rb:503: warning: Using the last argument as keyword parameters is deprecated; maybe ** should be added to the call
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is nothing worry some now. Matz doesn’t like keyword arguments, the way it was there till Ruby 2.6, checkout this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;316&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2g9R7PUCEXo?color=white&amp;amp;theme=light&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails is fast too. I can see it in Rails 6 + Ruby 2.7, but this bloody webpacker. I am using Rails for too long, first it was prototype and RJS and it was really cool, I loved it. Then came this bloody jQuery, and Rails move to it, we need to learn it, okay that went well, now this webpacker. Javascript ecosystem is still amateur and evolving and its causing headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent good amount of time knowing why we need webpacker, got jQuery, propperJS, and bootstrap working. Damn. And I did it all without knowing what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very unsatisfied with my work, and I am now working for my own product. But once I get my hands really on webpacker I think I might appreciate with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss the days of Volt framework when Rubyist were promised that they never need to lay hands on Javascript. I am really sad the way Opal is not integrated into Rails. We need to put up with amateurism and changing mind of Javascript community, and just as Javascript comes of age, it could be wiped out by WASM. Well….&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I Follow This Method Whenever My Brain Is struggling With A Complicated Programming Task.</title><link href="/programming/2020/01/12/i-follow-this-method-whenever-my-brain-is-struggling-with-a-complicated-programming-task.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I Follow This Method Whenever My Brain Is struggling With A Complicated Programming Task." /><published>2020-01-12T12:49:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-01-12T12:49:00+05:30</updated><id>/programming/2020/01/12/i-follow-this-method-whenever-my-brain-is-struggling-with-a-complicated-programming-task</id><content type="html" xml:base="/programming/2020/01/12/i-follow-this-method-whenever-my-brain-is-struggling-with-a-complicated-programming-task.html">&lt;p&gt;As a software engineer, I felt stuck countless times during project development. As a programmer, you might have experienced this feeling yourself, I bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless if it is work-related or in a personal endeavour, you usually start projects very enthusiastically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when a specific task feels too overwhelming, you tend to lose focus, procrastinate, and sometimes even question your very decision of pursuing a career in your current field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to share with you a simple way that will greatly help you overcome technically-challenging tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether developing software or trying to solve coding challenges, applying this method will help you finish your most complicated tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call this method: Elementary Task In Progress (ETIP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by elementary? By definition, an elementary task is a very simple and basic task that is hardly broken down into smaller, easier steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task in progress should always be elementary so that its execution is straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me clarify this further by asking you a question: “What is the most basic step you can do to get closer to finishing your complicated task?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identify that step. Turn it into a task on its own. Work on it. That’s your ETIP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are stuck in your project because the task in progress is too complicated, chances are, your task is not an ETIP. Turn it into an ETIP by applying the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Break the task in progress into simpler, more basic steps.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For each individual step, break it up even further until it is in its most elementary form. This is your ETIP.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick the first ETIP and start working on it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once done with your first ETIP, move to the next one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never work on a task that is not an ETIP!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, the task in progress should always be so elementary that its execution is straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you feel that your next task is too complicated? Time to break it down into ETIPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the ETIP method every time a task feels too overwhelming. Break your task into basic and simple steps that you can execute easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is almost unavoidable that you will encounter challenging and complex projects that are made up of complicated tasks, you should not work on a task unless you make sure its completion is simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ETIP method will help you to always progress in completing your projects no matter how big the challenges you are faced with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this advice will be helpful to you.&lt;/p&gt;
