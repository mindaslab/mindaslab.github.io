The power used to go off in office and we go to the backyard of the company where there was a small garden and chill out, ask about one another, make jokes and have fun. Sometimes we go to a  tea shop and have a sip and snacks. None thought any thing bad about us. The bosses knew to manage a tech team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today when we have power cuts, I get only negative feelings and remember a company I consulted. I was consulting for a company for Ruby on Rails, apparently they had messed up with such a beautiful framework and made it difficult to code. That’s excusable, but their micro services were poorly documented. That too was excusable if people were given proper time to fix documentation and code, but the boss seems to be an asshole. He wanted us to clock 12+ hours for his personal profits, and wanted us to code off tickets in a jiffy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me being a senior, and that guy having no idea how to develop a software, and wouldn’t listen to me, he expected me to code like devil, despite all those shortcomings, code I did, understanding their system I did, but if you change the framework so much, it’s not easy to understand unless you have proper documentation. They had unrealistic date estimate and I slipped often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s DMK rule now in Tamilnadu, and in DMK rule power cuts do happen, and it did happen. This made me slip more, when ever there was power cut I promptly informed my boss, but that guy seems to be an asshole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was covid peak season then, we allowed none in our home, but that guy insisted that I installed power backup for eight hours in my home, of course he won’t give any financial assistance for that, but he wanted it. He kept insisting that even though I kept saying there were old people in my home who are potential targets for Covid. In short that guy wasn’t bothered about me, my well being, my family’s well being, all he wanted was me to slave for him continuously for over 12 hours a day. It was hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to me joining he seems to have created more hell for his employees. Since he always suspected them, he made employees turn on their Zoom cameras from 2PM to 4PM and they have be be present on Zoom and code at the same time. I was shocked to hear this from my colleague. Another girl told me that he limited her lunch time to 30 minutes, I couldn’t take it. I couldn’t work under such a boss. That company had a bad HR too, one guy wanted to leave and the H.R abused him saying: ‘you are not working well here, how do you think you will work well in another company?’. To be frank that guy who left seemed to be the brightest person to me, he was not a yes boss person, may be that was his mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working there spoiled my health so much that I had to quit. They promised me to send a reliving letter in email and they haven’t done it for six months and I simply don’t like to ask them. I honestly feel these type of sadist bosses can never be fixed, only their death can give relief to the I.T industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it does pains, you do work with all your heart even though you get abused a bit, you love to code, so you do and the abuse builds up to such an extent its unbearable. When ever there is power cut I get reminded of this company and this boss, and the memory is not sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-manage-software&quot;&gt;How to manage software&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a very simple strategy to mitigate misestimation of software tickets, and it’s super simple, its called noestimate. That is you simply won’t estimate ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would show a ticket to a member in a team and will tell them to progress on it, you will track the progress and communicate with client. But even with decades of software experience people fall into the trap thinking that brain work is like repetitive brawn work and try to estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say I.T industry has got very bright people, but I am sure thats a myth, its got many people who do not know how to run project, and people who don’t know how to manage discrepancies and delays, all they do is to put pressure on people who really work. Those ind of are still stuck in the era of industrial age and never taken time to think about age of thought and knowledge. I feel nothing could be done about those brains that can’t think about how other brains think.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">There was time when I was an intern in a company back in 2002, we were coding for ABB PLC and all those stuff.

&lt;p&gt;Some how Buddhism seems to be the only religion that has cracked the psychology aspect of religion. We pray to God for want, want of something. It could be a material want or an emotional/psychological want. That is we desire for something. This desire is the cause of unhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you say you do not desire happiness and sadness, you do not desire wealth and poverty, you do not desire life and death, you just realize nothing is constant and everything is meaningless, then prayer to something that claims would give you these things become immaterial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For argument sake let’s assume that there is God, that God could control you only if you want something from him, if you want nothing from anyone, then it does not matter if something exists or does not exists. It does not matter if something happens or does not happen. You simply have realized the ultimate truth that nothing is constant and everything is meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;buddhism-is-not-a-religion&quot;&gt;Buddhism is not a religion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One must know that Buddhism is not a religion. Today there are many forms of Buddhism that’s not Buddhism at all. That is many forms of Buddhism explains that our suffering is because of our karma. In truth what is suffering and happiness if nothing is constant and everything is meaningless?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no previous or next births for karma to carry over. Buddha or Buddhists might have got that thing wrong. You can’t mistake them. Tools of thought at that time were not advanced enough to verify about soul, birth, incarnation and so on. But if you are a Buddhist (a seeker of knowledge and understanding), you must update yourself and throw away the old and bring in the new.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Time highlights inequality in India</title><link href="/2021/12/11/time-highlights-inequality-in-india.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Time highlights inequality in India" /><published>2021-12-11T10:17:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-12-11T10:17:00+05:30</updated><id>/2021/12/11/time-highlights-inequality-in-india</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2021/12/11/time-highlights-inequality-in-india.html">&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few days ago Indian army killed some Naga people, some where around dozen of them I think. It is said that the army was combing to find some terrorists, they tried to stop a vehicle that they want to inspect, when it did not stop, it was fired upon, and about a dozen got killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think just a day after that, India’s Chief of Defense Staff, his name was Bipin Rawat, climbed into an helicopter, was going via Kodai-kaanal (a place where there is no summer) to a  army training  base, when his helicopter seems to have been stopped by a jack fruit tree. The helicopter tried to push ahead, but it fell down, and all the people in it was fired upon by laws of physics. I think 14 died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing here is the 14 army people were honored with gun salutes and were honored like national hero’s and were cremated, buried etc, but I think the dozen or so Nagas were not announced that they too are hero’s who lost their lives in India’s fight against terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason civilians who died in Taj Hotel attacks by Pakistani terrorist are considered heroes, but not the Nagas. News showed the crying children of Indian army people, but we do not even know if the Nagas who died had a family. We do not know if they had a good life before death, and we won’t know if their loved ones will have a decent life in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a Nagas life is worth just 5 Lakhs. May be in the future we will have advertisement in papers where if one pays Rs 5 Lakhs (it could be more due to high inflation), one could kill a Naga as trophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has the government not treated Nagas like they treated Bipin Rawat? Or is the media is not covering the honored death of Nagas with 21 gun salute, where the president and prime minister visited and performed last rites? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Your browser does not support the video element.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Kerala Muslims should stop spitting on food</title><link href="/india/food/kerala/islam/halal/2021/12/02/kerala-muslims-should-stop-spitting-on-food.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kerala Muslims should stop spitting on food" /><published>2021-12-02T09:28:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-12-02T09:28:00+05:30</updated><id>/india/food/kerala/islam/halal/2021/12/02/kerala-muslims-should-stop-spitting-on-food</id><content type="html" xml:base="/india/food/kerala/islam/halal/2021/12/02/kerala-muslims-should-stop-spitting-on-food.html">&lt;p&gt;A month back I think I saw this video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
        &lt;source src=&quot;https://bafybeidweomi3ue2lgloeq6eoilc3wvoc7wc3nmtq5cfb7q4hg4jfnw2gy.ipfs.dweb.link/redditsave.com_is_it_true_kerala_people_spit_into_food_before-ttcdrtjhucy71.mp4 &quot; /&gt;

      &lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It shows a man either spitting or blowing on food. I had been to this state Kerala where I did eat and enjoy the food there, but after seeing this video I almost threw up. It is said that certain kind of Muslims in Kerala spit on their food to purify it and they also run large number of hotels. Yak. Yukeee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later it was revealed in some investigation that it was true that Muslims there consider spitting on food makes it Halal (that is Arabic for edible), and so they do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sent a media storm and finally now it looks like netizens in Kerala want to compile or are compiling a list of hotel’s where they don’t spit on food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I think the damage has already been done. I don’t think I will ever go to Kerala again. I wonder if its God’s country or spitters country. I wonder what worst practices they still hide and that are not known to the outside world for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is facing the worst because of religion. Our country is divided into three, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh solely because of religion. We have a religious government called the BJP, headed by a fanatic Narendra Modi, who is controlled by a terror outfit called the RSS which is hell bent on making India into just another Hindu Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China has given up religion and has emerged top of the world, Bangladesh has shed its Islamic identity and has raced ahead of India in per-capita GDP, we are following religion and are going back to the stone ages. It’s really stupid and sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Islam should refine, Quoran is 1000 years old may be, and what was okay then may not be okay now. I am sure all my Muslim won’t eat food that’s spit on it. Who ever these people are, even if they had to go to hell after death if they don’t spit, then they must say to their God: “so be it, I am not afraid of your hell and pain and suffering you will give to me”, and they must stop spitting on food. It’s disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A month back I think I saw this video:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">தீதும் நன்றும் பிறர் தர வாரா</title><link href="/2021/11/28/%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%80%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%A8%E0%AE%A9%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B1%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B1%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%B0-%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BE.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="தீதும் நன்றும் பிறர் தர வாரா" /><published>2021-11-28T11:29:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-11-28T11:29:00+05:30</updated><id>/2021/11/28/%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%80%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%A8%E0%AE%A9%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B1%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B1%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%B0-%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BE</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2021/11/28/%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%80%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%A8%E0%AE%A9%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B1%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B1%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%B0-%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BE.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;subtle-tone&quot;&gt;Subtle Tone&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture above is of potato masala, it’s tasty, but you can’t eat it just like that. You need to wrap in on dough and make it as samosa as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeiffyct4idr4spb3juwjgulzst46gybso35zq345rv5uhsi4fjjihe.ipfs.dweb.link/Indian_Samosa_by_clumsy_home_chef.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it becomes more edible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The below video is that of a parotta shop in Tamilnadu, India, it weighs 150MB, very good quality and it won’t break my website if you see it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, let me come to the first part.
Potato masala is tasty, but you can’t eat it just like that. You need a good interface like an oil roasted dough covering which converts it into samosa to make it palatable to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ipfs&quot;&gt;IPFS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s consider storing files. Long time back I came across this excellent technology called Inter Planetary File System (IPFS), I even used it to construct a block chain for one of my client’s project. I was in a company called Trumatics then. Then my partner got mad at me so frequent, I had to drop out. But the potential of IPFS was visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell it to you in brief. First imagine a website like YouTube. It simply isn’t scalable, they have scaled it, but to keep it afloat they need to put lot of annoying ads in it. That’s because of it’s architecture. You have a single end point &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com&quot;&gt;https://youtube.com&lt;/a&gt; into which you post a file and get it back, in this case a video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine an architecture where I watch a video from the internet, it’s so good that I tell you, and you start watching it, now the video get streamed to you from not only the original source, but from me too, or which ever source is nearby to you. That is rather than relying on centralized storage and distribution, this technology is like Torrent or the one implemented by Napster, Emule etc. In these technologies, as the client base grows, clients become host of the file too. IPFS is just like that. Plus if you put a file in IPFS it never get’s deleted if there are enough storage locations hosting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;file-coin&quot;&gt;File Coin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say a actress uploads her video, it get’s watched and stored by many in IPFS and would not get deleted for ages, but say you find a break trough stuff in science and upload a paper, not may would read it, and only your IPFS node would have it, if your computer get’s destroyed or disconnected, the video is lost!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine what if some one can mine coins just by storing your files, then they are getting incentivized, that’s the logic behind file coin. If you put a file in file coin network, you are kind of guaranteed that it will be there for ever, till say the internet is destroyed almost completely. File coin operates on IPFS by slapping a block chain on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tansferkit&quot;&gt;TansferKit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When ever you are doing a complex ticket and want to be really sure it works in production, it’s better to  take a copy of production db and test your changes locally. We mainly use Heroku for our Ruby on Rails deployments and this is to show how we do the production backup stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we must tell heroku to capture your production data base at current time. For that in your app folder type this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ heroku pg:backups:capture
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could get the information about the running backup using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ heroku pg:backups:info
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your DB is large, it will take some time, once the backup is completed, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;heroku pg:backups:info&lt;/code&gt; might throw out an output as shown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;=== Backup b001

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to give your data to a Data Analyst who is not added to your heroku project, you can get a downloadable URL of your backup using this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ heroku pg:backups:url
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get a dump of your backup using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ heroku pg:backups:download
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will create a file called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;latest.dump&lt;/code&gt; in your project folder, to restore it you can use this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -d local_db
_name latest.dump

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/linkedin_2021-11-09 at 09-39-00.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What? I thought. Previously I was interacting with lot of Data Scientists on Linkedin, I was telling them about my &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience-book.gitlab.io/&quot;&gt;Introduction To Data Science Book&lt;/a&gt;, encouraging them to read it and tell their opinions about it. As Linkedin correctly found out, I was looking into lot of profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One question I have for Linkedin is this. If Linkedin claims to be a social network, isn’t it a social behavior to meet and tell people about you and to know about them? Why is Linkedin is so pissed off by it and is blocking me from being social? I find it stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft people usually don’t have brains. You can see it from how crappy their operating system is, how complex their Azure service is compared to Linode. They buy companies, inject their greed and management practices into it and let it get devoid of its soul. Such a sad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish some network like &lt;a href=&quot;https://diasporafoundation.org/&quot;&gt;Diaspora&lt;/a&gt; has a way to ask people their education and company details. Once asked it can connect people accordingly. That’s it, we have Linkedin competitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linkedin does not generate its own data, people list data there so that they can be found, but Linkedin is doing the exact opposite of a social network. It’s obstructing people from contacting people who would like to be contacted. In other words its antisocial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diaspora and many free software social networks are distributed and open, they can develop an API where if the user is willing, any one can access their information and use it to contact them. This means by moving away from Linkedin, people will be truly linked in!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I was on Linkedin and suddenly I received this notification</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">DMK ministers are making fool of themselves</title><link href="/india/tamilnadu/politics/dmk/chennai/flood/corruption/2021/11/09/dmk-ministers-are-making-fool-of-themselves.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="DMK ministers are making fool of themselves" /><published>2021-11-09T07:59:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-11-09T07:59:00+05:30</updated><id>/india/tamilnadu/politics/dmk/chennai/flood/corruption/2021/11/09/dmk-ministers-are-making-fool-of-themselves</id><content type="html" xml:base="/india/tamilnadu/politics/dmk/chennai/flood/corruption/2021/11/09/dmk-ministers-are-making-fool-of-themselves.html">&lt;table&gt;

  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Ma. Subramanian (DMK Minister)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was telling to my friends that sooner or later DMK ministers will start blaming AIAMK for Chennai floods and it happened. I switched on the T.V and in it was Ma. Subramanian. Exactly as I was saying he said the flooding in Chennai was caused by AIADMK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there is simple question, if you promised good life in manifesto, you must deliver it. Since ADMK ruled Tamilnadu before and hence never can Tamil’s have a good life even if DMK comes to power, then it must be specified in manifesto as well. Has DMK manifesto said that they can’t provide us with good life during rains because ADMK ruled before? If not why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.nakkheeran.in/cdn/farfuture/UjIHjGoUOsiaKB5XAhmXenLVd7HaTUE2CSqWZOHG5Bk/1544698206/sites/default/files/inline-images/senthil%20balaji%2055.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Senthil Balaji (Power Minister)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, this power minister Senthil Balaji who before blamed squirrels for power cuts. He said people should be careful with power infrastructure during rains. My simple question is why? Why should we be careful? If infrastructure in Tamilnadu is not good enough to transmit power safely during rains, then don’t transmit power. Say that’s the state of power infrastructure. Why put this rule and that rule upon people all of a sudden? Say that Varuna Bhagavan doesn’t like Tamilnadu to have electricity, and let’s go back to the age where we had wooden and cow dung fires for energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short why can’t DMK admit they are party who cannot give us good life if AIADMK ruled before them. That’s what they are saying indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Ma.

&lt;p&gt;I follow some journalists on twitter, and one of them from THE HINDU tweeted a lot about Jai Bhim, I think even before the movie launched he tweeted how good it was. I thought he and THE HINDU were bribed by the producers of this movie. There was a reson, I think years before THE HINDU wrote lot of articles praising TATA motors, and TATA motors ads would appear in the paper. I bought a TATA nano and it was worst to say the least. So I have always doubted THE HINDU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But any way since they were promoting the movie, I decided to watch hoping that it would be just another waste of time, but at least I can relax at that time and build more bad opinions about THE HINDU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy oh boy, I was absolutely wrong! Wrong wrong wrong! The story is about a layer named Chandru or something, this guy helped oppressed people like workers, kuravars and many many more to get their rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know that Tamilnadu police treats us very badly. In the theft takes place, a cop does not know how to solve it (I think he was aiding the thief), so he arrests a suspected kuruvan who was there in that house for catching snake earlier. That kuravan had never committed the crime, the police torture him to death and plays a dram that accused escaped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police were super cunning and planted false evidences and witnesses to make people believe these people really made out of the prison. It took the brilliant work of Chandru to bring things to light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;possibly-the-greatest-terrorist-organization&quot;&gt;Possibly the greatest terrorist organization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jai Bhim is brilliant movie, it exposes possibly the greatest terrorist organization that’s there in this nation. If a terrorist kills, he admits he killed some one, and may be if we want to hang that terrorist, he won’t be afraid to be a martyr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Tamilnadu Police is far far more cunning, they want to inflict terror upon people, yet they wish not to die or get hurt by it. It’s a coward way of living, but that’s how Tamilnadu police is says this movie. It’s a slap on their face. but the police won’t bothe, I’m sure, they are far far evil to be shaken by a movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt bad, I go around telling my fiends to install solar cells on their roofs, urge them to buy electric vehicles so that we import less oil. Our oil spending is used by Islamic nations to fund terrorist activities against us just because some guy called Muhammad, who at that time starved in caves and illusion-ed that he met God’s angels told that Islam would spread to India. So bad! So these idiots now want to convert entire India into an Islamic nation. It’s a stupid thought, but that’s what they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But greater than them we have a great terror organization amongst us which we cannot reform or be destroy or change in any way. That’s the movies point. I feel it’s a good thing to bring evil to light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look no further, we have this Thuthukudi massacre which Edapaadi Palanisamy (EPS) did, he hasn’t been hanged yet (this proves that there is no difference between ADMK and DMK, and they have some form of nexus), a terrorist murdered people for EPS so possibly he can et lot from Vendata.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Felix &amp;amp; Jayaraj. Father Son Duo who was murdered by Tamilnadu police for fun.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we have this Felix and Jayaraj who were murdered for fun by the police, and we all know those murderers will escape and we can do nothing about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disrespecting-the-true-indians&quot;&gt;Disrespecting the true Indians&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/165/352752649_01bd238ea9_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;A Kuravan selling beads necklace&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jai Bhim also tells about the Kuravar community. It’s possible they were in India even before Dravidian civilization took shape in Africa, and reached India via Mesopotamia and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8a/7c/40/8a7c40aae9ef6d5a4e225e8cb0af0494.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Valli the Kurathi, new wife of Muruga welcomed by his first wife Devaiyani&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were the guardians of the forrest, fortune tellers, they brought us the wealth of nature without destroying it. It’s said Lod Muruga fell in love with a Kurathi and married her. But look now how we treat them? Agriculture has destroyed our forrest, and industries are destroying our agriculture. The Kuravars are left helpless, our system has shut out the true people of our land in favor of invading Dravidians and Aryans. that’s very sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;movies-should-be-like-this&quot;&gt;Movies should be like this&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually Tamil movie is nothing but a love affair between hero and heroine, and before they can fuck each other, they have to do 4 dances, and the hero had to do 4 fights to impress the girl. That’s it. This movie is totally different. They want to make a movie this time and not a circus and call it a movie. That’s refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie looks so believable (though I believe the murderers were never hanged and managed to escape), and this is how movies should be. But I have no hopes for future Tamil movies, they just want to make money and will return back to cheap quality soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-must-watch&quot;&gt;You must watch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only if we know evils in our society, at least we will start taking about let, let alone destroying it. No Indian has the balls to challenge these evils. At least know what these evils are and pretend to act like a man.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
