      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;The Death of Socrates&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I thought you how to live, I’ll teach you how to die - Socrates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many parts of the world, one can choose their own leaders. Well, that’s what we are told to believe, and we are also told that we have control of our life, it’s our life and our right until we infringe upon some one else’s right. Well then why shouldn’t one have the right to kill oneself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-are-not-infringing-on-others-right&quot;&gt;You are not infringing on others right&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When one kills himself, or the better herself :D, that person is not infringing on other peoples right, but they are just shutting off. That’s it. It’s their idea that this universe and humanity sucks and they don’t belong here, I feel if any society calls itself free should honour it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-they-tell-its-wrong&quot;&gt;Why they tell its wrong&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really know why they say it’s wrong and why many religious and political leaders encourage one to live despite making lives hard. May be because if say some one says “God I want mutton briyani now”, and to his dismay discovers that God doesn’t deliver and he kills himself, then the amount of money the religious leader gets when all people who discover that God does not exist and commit suicide dwindles. The religious leader, can’t have a great life, and most religious leaders are control freaks who want to control lot of people. If people are not afraid of death, then this control becomes really hard, and if they don’t work for him he may not have the life he or she desires. Imagine how Nithyanadha would feel of Ranjitha killed herself rather than sleeping with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till this day, we were made to believe leaders of business, religion and politics should be respected and its because of them people have a better life, but when Corona struck and human interaction was banned the world productivity dropped, some how all of a sudden the world realised that it’s productivity comes out of people who work, rather than from the people who have money, dream and thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He who is not afraid to die is your master - Roman saying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus say your boss threatens you with a miserable life, only to find out that you have killed yourself the next day, he would feel frustrated, definitely his business would suffer some loss, and if people are bold enough to commit suicide, bosses can’t really abuse them. Human productivity is built on abuse, frustration, sweat and blood than humaness. If people escape these things quick, then these people can’t say to the world they had made it more productive and they are successful and have a large house, a car because of their work (which they really didn’t do).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly its because of that its said that killing yourself is cowardice and the comedy is throwing before enemy fire and defending against enemy is also a near act of suicide, but those things are glorified :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one getting killed is wrong if it’s weakens the institutional leaders, and if killing of you strengthens them, then it’s right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spain-granting-rights-to-die&quot;&gt;Spain granting rights to die&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I saw a news that Spain is granting rights to die for people who are in severe medical pain. That’s a good step, but I feel its rubbish that any civilisation could call itself free if it does not allow killing of oneself as easy buying a briyani. But ya briyani is prized really high because of human stupidity, well that’s another blog.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Death of Socrates</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How Indian middle class can end Islamic terrorism?</title><link href="/energy/renewable/india/saudi%20arabia/religion/islam/politics/corruption/terrorism/2021/03/11/how-indian-middle-class-can-end-islamic-terrorism.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How Indian middle class can end Islamic terrorism?" /><published>2021-03-11T21:53:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-03-11T21:53:00+05:30</updated><id>/energy/renewable/india/saudi%20arabia/religion/islam/politics/corruption/terrorism/2021/03/11/how-indian-middle-class-can-end-islamic-terrorism</id><content type="html" xml:base="/energy/renewable/india/saudi%20arabia/religion/islam/politics/corruption/terrorism/2021/03/11/how-indian-middle-class-can-end-islamic-terrorism.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/123AD/production/_97796647_gettyimages-76069264.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If voting made a difference,
they wouldn’t let us do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As middle class of India, we run this nation. Vijay Mallaya, Neerav Modi, Lali Modi, loot and get away abroad, here this Modi boasts he does this thing and and that thing and does nothing but to crash our economy even before the great pandemic. For every loss our baapus make, the looting that our politician do, tax evasion our bosses make, we middle class have paid ta for it (like huge taxes in petrol, even salt and toothpaste is taxed, our income too is taxed) and we are the true citizens of India. We never felt proud about it as we are looted every second, and we never boasted about it. We have always felt things are out of our hand, and thats true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But time is very strange, it gives an opportunity for us to change something. I am not talking about Democracy. No matter what ever party comes to power, they will obey the rich and ignore others. I am talking about energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My house is on a dirt road for the 14 years of my stay in Sithalapakaam, we had nothing but dirt road. Vehicles pass, and even for minimum of traffic dut gets settled every where in my room. Imagine if we can reduce oil import, save our nation money, say we save Rs 100/-, I am sure Rs 99/- will be looted away, but the Re 1/- might go into making my road a tar road. So please read this blog to know hw you can save my country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-modi-wont-eliminate-terrorist&quot;&gt;Why Modi won’t eliminate terrorist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://theindiaobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/31895204_10214039392993167_7017601988976181248_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modi is simply stupid. In his short rule, Vajpyee fought Kargil, exploded nukes, brought Pakistan to its knees, with 7 years of Modi rule he must have liberated Boluchistan and Sindh from Pakistan, instead he sank us into despair with demonitization. One of the reason given was terrorist have their money in Rs 500/- and Rs 1000/- notes, and if this demonitization happens it will cripple them. Are we free of terrorism now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modi simply has the ability to make news and do nothing in reality. He just wants fame and an illusion to surround him, that illusion is he must always feel that he is the greatest priminister ever, which is rubbish. I think he is competing with Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi to become one of the worst priminister this nation had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RSS, BJP and Modi need the Arabs, the Terrorist, because they are organisations that is built on hate of Muslims and Christians. If these people are gone, then it becomes pointless for them to exist. The same way Pakistan military needs India to justify its existence to Pakistani people and loot them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modi is just a show. He can’t eliminate terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prophet-muhammed-did-not-exist&quot;&gt;Prophet Muhammed did not exist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s come to Islam. None knows if Prophet Muhammed really existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9S_xbjIRgE?color=white&amp;amp;theme=light&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/iframe&gt;
     &lt;/figure&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if he did, he is definitely disillusioned person. We have lot of swamiji’s that claim they have seen God, heard God’s messages. Do we believe them? We feel they are better off meeting a psychologist than telling idiotic stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we have tools of science and lot of documentation to probe into the brain, but imagine war torn Arabia, they never had these tools and these thoughts we have now, and they suffered a lot. So lot of messiahs rose. One of them could be Muhammed or he might have been a person who was made up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramayana was written because Aryans envied us and wanted to conquer us. They want to paint us as monkeys and demons, they wanted us to be some one who should either serve them or be destroyed. In similar way the Arab had their eyes on India and Rome, both are very profitable trading regions. It’s very possible that they inserted text into Quoran that it’s the will of God and words said by Muhammad that Islam would conquer Rome and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though many nations have left the desire to Isamize India because we have been steadily raising in power ever since independence despite the huge corruption we have, the existence of Pakistan cannot be justified if India wasn’t its enemy, so its holding onto this dream. Being a Sunni nation, Saudi Arabia supports Pakistan in all ways possible, because any nation thats controlled by Islam is a territory controlled by Mecca which os owned by the Saud’s for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must be very careful with Aryans and Arabs. Or we will be known as slaves in History.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-want-khaliphet-in-chennai&quot;&gt;We want Khaliphet in Chennai&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very certain that still the idea of Kaliphat, that is all of the world should be ruled by a single Islamic leader is there in the minds of many hard core Muslims. Rather than the acknowledging the progress we humans have made, outgrowing religion and growing into science, these religious leaders want to take it back. Not even a decade ago I think a friend of mine told me that while he was travelling in bus in Mount Road, may be somewhere between the U.S consulate and Thousand Lights mosque he saw a bunch of protesting Muslims who were shouting “we don’t want democracy, we want kalipha”. He was shocked, because these muslims were in Tamilnadu and had grown with us and had been an indispensable part of us, yet somehow they are controlled by the age old Arabic thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must be very careful of these forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Religion is poison. - Mao Zedong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;oil-or-energy-is-islam&quot;&gt;Oil (or energy) is Islam&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.gettyimages.com/vectors/oil-derrick-inside-symbol-of-islam-vector-id516214527&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few days ago I saw an article that Saudi Arabia wants to be a leader in Hydrogen future. So they now know people won’t buy into this Oil myth any more. Islam, the radical one, some may say it’s not Islam at all, is now fuelled by Saudi Arabian Oil. The Sauds know that the world is shifting, even though batteries can store renewable power, to store in such huge quantities as the world energy needs grows, there isn’t known Lithium deposits that are present on Earth. One of the best was t store power is by splitting water, and storing that Hydrogen either liquified, or as ammonia or as methane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Arabia is blessed with Abundant sunlight so they can split up water by electrolysis and ship the hydrogen. We in India who have abundant sunshine, buy hydrogen from these terror sponsors, we will be killed by them possibly even into the next millennium. This should stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-solar-power&quot;&gt;Use solar power&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sustainabilitynext.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/solar-panels.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can we middle class can do? Much of middle class live in flat system or in rental homes. This blog is not for them. For people who are living in their own independent homes consider switching to solar power. The initial invest would be high, but it will pay off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First electrify your home with solar, this will cut our nations coal import. Next if you are using LPG for cooking, disconnect it, move to electric stoves, microwaves and electric ovens. In fact we are getting our LPG from possible terror sponsoring nations. Next buy electric car, it will charge over night using solar power stored in batteries, so in the morning its like having a car who’s petrol tank has been filled for free. Plus electric car means less maintenance. This when done by lakhs of Indian middle class families will surely give a blow to these nations that sell us energy and use it to conduct terror attacks on our nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-dont-trust-the-government&quot;&gt;Why I don’t trust the government&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might say the government is doing solar power projects and big companies are involved in it, so why should we do it. I say why not? We know the speed of the government, we know that government can play politics and it’s easy for them to get bribes from few power companies than some how forcing 1 crore or so middle class families to bribe them just because we now produce our won power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next a central provider means transmission losses, these can be cut if power can be obtained from our roof tops. Even if its power companies are private, you can’t say there is no politics and corruption inside those corporates. So power lines may fail one day. There is chance of having monopolies and duopolies so nothing good happens to us ultimately which roof top solar avoids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History does not give the weak and oppressed much chance. It gave us a chance in 1940’s as Hitler tried to invade Britain and we used it to gain independence. Now I feel we are getting a rare chance to circumvent politicians, religion, corporates who are oppressing us now to get partial power independence. Let’s grab it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May be if 10 billion dollars are saved a year, may be out of that 100 million might be put for public use after 99% corruption, and possibly in that some money might be used to convert the dirt road I live in into a tar road, thus improving my standard of my living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its all in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why Neighbours Watch on Myanmar’s Killings</title><link href="/power/politics/asia/class%20warfare/myanmar/2021/03/02/why-neighbours-watch-on-myanmar-s-killings.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why Neighbours Watch on Myanmar&apos;s Killings" /><published>2021-03-02T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-03-02T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/power/politics/asia/class%20warfare/myanmar/2021/03/02/why-neighbours-watch-on-myanmar-s-killings</id><content type="html" xml:base="/power/politics/asia/class%20warfare/myanmar/2021/03/02/why-neighbours-watch-on-myanmar-s-killings.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.worldtravelguide.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Think-Myanmar-Yangon-120786004-petrzurek-copy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tuned into Al-Jazeera today and predictably the military Junta in Myanmar has started to fire live ammunition into the crowds. My initial instinct was Myanmar is our sister nation, we share more history and culture with it. Its writing looks like more of old Tamil, Telugu and Kannada as they were developed curved representations so that it could be written on palm  leaves without tearing it. Myanmar is a Buddhist nation, a religion thats purely Indo-Napalese, but what’s Nepal without India? They are 100% our blood. But its neighbours are mute. Only Indonesia is trying to rake up the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People might say don’t get involved in politics, stay safe, but it because of evil minds and bad politics, lives are lost in Myanmar. For people of a country to prosper, it’s not just that country, even its neighbours should be right. Unfortunately Myanmar has got wrong neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact if people of Myanmar were okay for military intervention by its neighbours, then Indian and Bangladeshi artillery should be firing, troops should be amassing on Myanmar while Indian missiles streak in and strike their military targets thus weakening them and giving the people an upper hand. Yet we act as though people of our blood when killed it doesn’t matter. Why so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bangladesh&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/very_big_1/public/feature/images/2021/02/28/mushtaq-.jpg?itok=wjBikphv&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Slain Bengali Writer Mushtaq Ahmed&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its funny. Bangladesh was born because the will of people there was oppressed by Pakistan so much that people started to pour into India. And having limited resources and India being starving nation then, we had to fix it. We simply can’t keep feeding people thrown out by our neighbour, so we indulged in war, defeated Pakistan, and may be we were paid damages thus offsetting loss. Yes war is Economics, don’t mistake it. Ever wonder why the world watches 1000’s killed in Africa today? There is no money there. None will thank, plead guilty and pay you if you conquer that hell infested land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay coming back to Bangladesh. Today its just the opposite. We have got Bengali government that has enacted  Digital Security Act (DSA), arrested people and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/world/asia/bangladesh-mushtaq-ahmed-dead.html&quot;&gt;one prominent guy even died in custody for a facebook post&lt;/a&gt;. Mushtaq Ahmed is his name. Bengalis are rising up against the government and government needs to quell them. Now this situation is like very similar to Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So think, the Bengali government wants to silence its own people, now how can it say to Myanmar that please let freedom of public opinion in your nation while I silence my people with DSA?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;india&quot;&gt;India&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://stb.india.com/bengali/sites/default/files/styles/zm_700x400/public/2014/10/05/29672-modi10514.jpg?itok=fhJdH6OK&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Our Modi Mastan&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I talk about India? Oh God! This Modi. All of a sudden farm bills are brought into force without discussion in parliament. PubG and TikTok are ban with claims that they will hurt Chinese economy, thats the intelligence this government has. Now all of a sudden there is law, once gain without discussion in parliament on OTT platform regulation. When people revolted against polluting Vedanta copper plants in Thuthukudi, they were shot and killed like dogs and neither Modi or Edapaadi Palanisamy has been hung for it. Protesting farmers are ignored, the PM won’t speak with them. This government is experimenting all ways to undermine democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why on Earth India under such a dictator would even want to raise a hair against Myanmar? In fact Modi and his team will be observing taking notes from the Junta so that BJP can gain absolute power here in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thailand&quot;&gt;Thailand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/King_Rama_X_official_%28crop%29.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I think Thai’s are supposed to worship this guy as God&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thailand though its Priminister is elected democratically, none can touch its monarchy. They can do what they want and none can question them. Unfortunately people of Myanmar are part of 10,000+ year old east Asian culture where there are classes. the class of Kings, the class of Bosses, the class of Workers, the lower classes cannot question the upper ones, it’s a huge taboo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact if I visit Thailand, I could get a life term just for writing these words. That’s how worst Thailand is. Do you think Thailand will raise its voice against similar minded oppressive Junta?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-for-myanmar&quot;&gt;What’s for Myanmar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54ca8e44b624d6910574b5ea/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We the people of India should not forget that Myanmar is facing these huge problems and its people are left helpless because non democratic nature of countries surrounding it. First we as Indians should try to make our country more democratic so that our neighbours become democratic too, and help will arrive if one day we too are oppressed by Modi, Amit Shah or the Gandhis or who ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember this is not just Myanmar’s problem. This is a class war between people who think who can control public and public who think they should be having voice. This war is taking place in the deepest regions of Africa, in the companies I worked, and in the glittering place called USA. There is always and oppressor and oppressed. The oppressor is always afraid of free speech, alternate opinion and truth leaking out. I hope humans are smart enough to break open it. I hope people around the world start seeing this as a local problem in many places and unite to fight the oppressors who oppress us and the oppressor within us which wants to conquer the Universe and become The God.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">When a Honest White Collar Man Should Start a Business?</title><link href="/india/economics/finance/business/2021/02/27/when-a-honest-white-collar-man-should-start-a-business.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="When a Honest White Collar Man Should Start a Business?" /><published>2021-02-27T13:30:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-02-27T13:30:00+05:30</updated><id>/india/economics/finance/business/2021/02/27/when-a-honest-white-collar-man-should-start-a-business</id><content type="html" xml:base="/india/economics/finance/business/2021/02/27/when-a-honest-white-collar-man-should-start-a-business.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://il6.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/7482508/thumb/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my friends who are middle class wanted to start a business. Something they must start they say. Even I used to say the same to them. I used to say if we have a bonda shop, only 1 out of 10 people will complain for the sake of complaining, but in I.T because we normally work under highly ignorant and skill less people we get a lot of complaints even before we finish anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my friends bravely attempted o start ventures, but fortunately we asked them to spread sheet stuff, and here is what we found. It takes Rs 40 Lakhs to set up a small business, say a store or take away or some thing. It would take about 6 months to 2 years for Return of Investment (ROI), so these are the conditions to start a business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is you must not have any other loan, yes, once you started a business depending on competition you might need to sink in more money, so you must not have any other loan, else you could have burden upon burden that will crush you. The second criteria is you must not get money from any other person to start a business. You are starting a business because there is a purpose for it, and you need autonomy to run it. Having friends, relatives and so on will rob that autonomy until and unless one of you is the leader and all others are dumb. Or you must get involved in unnecessary fights spoiling your tranquility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In India now, loans are not so expensive, but if you don’t pay them back then your life is gone 100%, it will be recorded and none will give finance. Since facebook is involved in financial prediction, possibly your kid and your friends will also be flagged red and orange and they won’t get a loan too. So loan is ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how to generate that 40 lakhs? Simple, have a savings of 10 crores in an interest giving scheme, this will generate 5 Lakhs of interest, of that you will get 3 lakhs per month after tax. Live frugally and in a bank account accumulate 40 Lakhs in 2 years, that will serve the base for business of full independence. Since you are getting 3 Lakhs after tax just like that, even if the business jitters you will have something to sink in to keep the business is afloat provided your wife, kids, relatives and friends don’t drain your money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might say that you will never get 10 crores in life, then shut up, increase your skill, and earn with that skill and die with dignity if possible. That’s what India is right now. as a middle class this nation does not give you a second chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this blog looks really pessimistic then re-read the title.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why I Think Modi Economics is Stupid</title><link href="/2021/02/23/why-i-think-modi-economics-is-stupid.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why I Think Modi Economics is Stupid" /><published>2021-02-23T11:53:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-02-23T11:53:00+05:30</updated><id>/2021/02/23/why-i-think-modi-economics-is-stupid</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2021/02/23/why-i-think-modi-economics-is-stupid.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal%2F2019-06%2F963c2b44-928d-41c5-a9db-7bd9df06c2d9%2Fmodi_yoga_video.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a firm believer that people who have very strong opinion that are not based on facts are ultra stupid who can never be changed. In fact a good mind should mind his or her business and get ahead in life than even thinking of changing them. This blog, or the opinion of countless thinkers definitely won’t change the BJP, but the government will have a hard fall due to its illogical economic practice of taxing the middle class for the benefit of its rich friends. When that happens then I feel if a good government that is not controlled by the corporates emerge, then possibly a very similar policy written in this blog might follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-poori-idli-story&quot;&gt;The Poori Idli Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.awesomecuisine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/poori-masala-kizhangu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hotelier in a town was selling Poori and Potato as a breakfast food, and it was popular. The person who supplied oil to make poori wanted to conquer the hotel, so using the oil money he earned from the sale of oil to the hotelier, he hired some rowdies to harass and attack the hotel. The hotel guy had no choice. Poori was his great sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images2.thestatesman.com/uploads/images/2017/02/04/1486189244-idli-517.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day the hotelier heard a dish named idli. It does not need to be fried in oil, hence when made it will weaken the oil seller who wants to take control of the hotel. Next idli is a dish that is far healthier than poori, but how to introduce it in the town?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Production of idli costs, it requires investment into steamers. You just can’t take dough and roll it to become idli, you need knowledge of fermentation and art to make it. So initially idli would cost more. So to make people eat idli, the hotelier doubled and tripled poori price. People avoided his hotel and new guy was able to buy the hotel for a cheap rate because of its tumbling profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hotel is India. The poori is carbon emitting fossil fuel vehicles. The idlis are electric vehicles. The oil seller is Arab who always dreams that the whole world should be controlled by him because some book said so. The change of hands of hotel is nothing but the fall of BJP to possibly a better economically minded government that might care more for the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-should-be-done&quot;&gt;What Should Be Done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what should be done? How to make people eat more and fill their stomach, but still oil is avoided and we have healthy idlis. I am sorry if I had misled the reader, the idli here is electric transport. This section will tell  my opinion and ideas how to make India’s transport electric.
ß&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;reduce-petroleum-price&quot;&gt;Reduce Petroleum Price&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.theweek.in/content/dam/week/news/india/images/2021/2/16/petrol-price.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First reduce petroleum cost. This will stimulate the economy, put more money into peoples pocket, people will have the urge to travel more. The more people want to travel the more commerce and more vehicle sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next increase the cost of production of fossil fuel vehicles. Put a good tax on it. So you are shifting the burden from people to industry which should have a sufficient money base. So though people can travel with vehicles with cheaper petrol price, only the people who can afford a lot can purchase a vehicle that emits carbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reduce-pollution&quot;&gt;Reduce Pollution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mygaragestory.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Emission-Test-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As carbon tax, have very strict pollution control methods. So people must maintain carbon vehicles and that would cost, that means more money flow into the economy, into mechanical shops, into small industries that make parts for carbon emitting vehicles. Ofcourse you are robbing the people here, but possibly offsetting it in hospital bills which are caused due to pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next have green zones in many important parts of nation where you can get in with carbon vehicles only after paying a hefty fee. These green zones could be highly posh real estate area, hospital and school regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So by now you have got people who can travel but they have to be very responsible. I wish all these stuff are done slowly than in a hasty way which is typical of Modi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reduce-electricity-cost&quot;&gt;Reduce Electricity Cost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*oE_1iCFDAW8i7fr1ViOSSw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the above points are going on, this is the time time to reduce the cost of electricity. You see you have slashed the car sales, made petroleum cheap so that goods prices don’t get affected, now its time to reduce the electricity cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the easiest way to reduce electricity cost is to fund transmission grid so that losses will be reduced. Try making it smart. Still people come to my home and take electrical reading, make it automatic so that its taken away from my credit card. See how you can reduce the cost of generating electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another big thing is electrical storage. You might be tempted to build big storage solutions if renewables come in, but wait, can’t storage be distributed? Reduce cost of home installation solar power. Make people generate and sell excess solar electricity so that it adds some earning to them. Make batteries cheaper so that each home can store tiny amount of electricity, thus a million homes might add up to some storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you encourage domestic solar power production than relying on big companies that are your friends, you will cultivate lot of MSME’s that offer solar solutions. They will have the independence and autonomy and they will create numerous localised jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is if people can create electricity at a mere throw away price, or can earn from generation of it, then if they can buy electric vehicles and charge it, its as equivalent as putting petrol into cars for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;encourage-electric-cars&quot;&gt;Encourage Electric Cars&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_in/seo/default/tata-launches-compact-suv-nexon-ev-in-india_y5q4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to reduce the cost of idli than raising the price of poori. Its time to get in electric mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government should first walk the talk. It can start to purchase electric vehicles and stop using carbon vehicles for its staff. Say the postal service, equip most postmen in the nation with electric scooters. Put a solar powered charging station in every post office if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk with people who could make electric vehicle. Give them a waiver of import duty. If an local industry is manufacturing part for electric vehicle maker, make the transaction tax free. Make electric vehicle zero tax. Electric vehicles already has no road tax I think, so thats good. So if one has electric vehicle, a solar roof, he almost has no running cost to bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try increasing automation in EV manufacturing factories so that labor problems could be avoided and cost could be further reduced. If small companies can convert existing gasoline vehicles to electric, encourage them so that they will add more employment and slowly carbon vehicles are reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one is buying a EV for commercial use, give that person 15 year car loan. It’s not just farmers are the only people in this land. Drivers are humans too. Remove toll 100% for EV’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put up charging stations all over the nation. Involve MSME’s for this so that labor intensive task it becomes. Make power available for EV’s at dirt pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doing the above stuff and along with some other things, cost of owning a EV’s will drop below that of carbon vehicles and people will start to switch. Now that’s how you sell more idlis than poori. Not by increasing the cost of eating poori.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Running PHP on Mac M1</title><link href="/2021/02/18/running-php-on-mac-m1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Running PHP on Mac M1" /><published>2021-02-18T14:18:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-02-18T14:18:00+05:30</updated><id>/2021/02/18/running-php-on-mac-m1</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2021/02/18/running-php-on-mac-m1.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.codigofonte.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/php-elephant.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mac is stupid for development. I got a assignment from a friend for writing his PHP site. He had contracted a PHP programmer for cheap, and just like any cheap programmer the code of the site was bad, non reusable, inconsistent UI and UX were there and changes made added to complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code was full of inconsistencies and trailing white spaces. I use Ruby for creation of websites, but my friend had bought a cheap hosting provider and was unwilling to change, that hosting provider gave only PHP on his servers for dirt pricing. So I had to do with PHP on Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trying-out-xamp&quot;&gt;Trying out XAMP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XAMP is a wonderful tool to run AMP stack (Apache, Maria DB, PHP) on any OS. I first installed on it on my laptop and tried. To my horror for some reason PHP files got downloaded rather than it being executed on server and HTML sent back. Mac sucks in development, the support was bad it took very long time to figure it out. You see it may be due to XAMP using PHP 8 and I later found out that my Mac had inbuilt PHP 7 which could be the cause of the issue. These mismatches means some how XAMP PHP won’t work on Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this kind of problem occurred on Ubuntu GNU/Linux, then it would be going to a forum and a 20 minute fix, because this happened in mac, it took nearly a day to find the solution. Pheeew!! Mac sucks for development, its a closed box and good enough developers should not use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now knowing that XAMP won’t work properly, I switched to Mac’s internal installation. thankfully XAMP had an uninstall script which I triggered to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-macs-apache-and-php&quot;&gt;Using Mac’s Apache and PHP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, Mac has inbuilt Apache and PHP. Why a company which builds opaque OS and Processors that does not disclose about it to developers includes these software? I don’t know. So start Apache like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ apachectl start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; in your browser and you should see this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/php_mac_m1/apache_works.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now edit this file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo vi /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that find this one&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;LoadModule php7_module libexec/apache2/libphp7.so
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and uncomment it if its commented, if you can’t find it add it at last. Now in finder locate &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/Library/WebServer/Documents/&lt;/code&gt; and right click on it and click Get Info, it must show something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/php_mac_m1/changing_folder_permissions.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that I have added myself and given me Read and Write permissions. Now restart Apache like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ apachectl restart
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place your PHP files in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/Library/WebServer/Documents/&lt;/code&gt; and access it in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you  are a Mac user, my only advise is don’t be a stupid, switch to GNU/Linux.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why you must not buy Apple M1</title><link href="/2021/02/14/why-you-must-not-buy-apple-m1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why you must not buy Apple M1" /><published>2021-02-14T20:19:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-02-14T20:19:00+05:30</updated><id>/2021/02/14/why-you-must-not-buy-apple-m1</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2021/02/14/why-you-must-not-buy-apple-m1.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/product/mac/standard/Apple_new-m1-chip-graphic_11102020_big.jpg.large.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who know me know that I am against Apple. Apple is just another black box, possibly a spying machine that sits right in your home. Who knows right now a NSA agent might be looking at me on camera, ya its Feb 14th today, so if its a woman she would be hopelessly in love with me. But I got a M1, why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I was in a situation, my personal Ubuntu GNU/Linux Lenovo machine started giving me problems, its screen went kaput and it took 6K to replace it and it was a poor work. Due to sloppy workmanship by S.S. Computer, Sithalapakkam, just a month after repair, its keyboard started failing. I was in a situation where I had no real projects and commitments at that time, but I was bugged by my friend to finish a Data Science project. My Lenovo got busted when it was analysing 60,000 images for a machine learning problem, its ENTER key won’t work at last. The Data Science experiment in it s i3 hardware was slow, waitful and painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends office uses Mac. He and his employees are idiots. He is definitely an idiot, and he would give salary to his employees only if they behave like idiot too. So to be with their ecosystem he asked me to use Mac. M1 is a well architected processor and is very bold in its innovations, I respect that, so I said yes. So an expensive an laptop landed on my desk. I couldn’t get System 76, or other really awesome GNU/Linux machines because they do not serve India. I can’t let him wait for long, so if he pays the money its okay for me. That’s how I ended up having a Mac. The shipment was slow, that wait for nearly a month. A person who codes every day, a month without coding was an unimaginable stuff, but I endured it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let me say how mac sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-for-true-developers&quot;&gt;Not for true developers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I can’t have GNOME, KDE, XFCE on it as Apple won’t let them run it. So I am stuck with the crappy UI Apple offers. Can you imagine my friend who is an computer engineer himself, I am not kidding, he really is and he really is chooses Apple to develop? In apple you don’t even have a decent terminal, you have to use a thing called &lt;a href=&quot;https://iterm2.com/&quot;&gt;iTerm&lt;/a&gt;. It’s for babies this computer was designed for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wifi-issues--dumb-users&quot;&gt;Wifi Issues &amp;amp; Dumb Users&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WiFi sucks. Suddenly it gets disconnected and even if I tell it to connect the connection keeps dropping. There is no solution for it. Unlike GNU/Linux where there is so much support, for Mac, no. Even if you chat for support they (the Apple folks) answer you like idiots. When you talk to a person who uses GNU/Linux you can see that he understands you because he understands computers, but Apple people look dumb all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sloppy-ux&quot;&gt;Sloppy UX&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I have used Mac OS now and then for 6 years I think. Each time forced by some one who wants to pay me. Unlike GNU/Linux where the UI has many iterations and changes and is refined constantly, here just look when I drag and drop a picture, it just stay in the folder just like that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sloppy_ux.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The icons never rearrange. God. What’s wrong with Apple? Why are they so dumb and yet so rich? Why is Javascript the worst programming language and yet so popular? I simply don’t understand humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;large-program-size&quot;&gt;Large Program Size&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/large_program_size.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the image above. Mac wants to update Keynote, its presentation software and it costs 340MB+. Almost any software you install is 100MB+ and you start wondering what the heck. Yes even in Ubuntu GNU/Linux, after this stupid snaps and flatpacks, the size has increased too, So this can’t be said as unique Apple problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;battery-drains-when-screen-is-bright&quot;&gt;Battery drains when screen is bright&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battery drains fast when the screen is bright. Or else the longevity of the battery is awesome, it drains only 60% in 9 hours of use. Thats good. Even when I played a near 1 hour game of 0AD, it drained only 11%, that too this happened in a laptop which was quiet and fan less! Now that’s a miracle. But the battery soon starts to drain a percent per minute as soon as you work in sunny conditions where screen must be bright. So it sucks if you don’t live in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;crappy-software&quot;&gt;Crappy Software&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally Apple’s software sucks compared to that of GNU/Linux, but there are programs like Apple Books which are supposed to open and Ebook and they won’t do so. You can only view that that program has detected your Ebook, but you can’t open it. Once again if you ask Apple people they will respond its a good program. They simply don’t have the intelligence to listen to you like GNU/Linux guys. Worst, you can’t uninstall this shit program!! I don’t know why? there isn’t a decent Chess program like &lt;a href=&quot;https://pychess.github.io/&quot;&gt;PyChess&lt;/a&gt; on Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-good-stuff&quot;&gt;Some Good Stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M1 is fast, &lt;a href=&quot;/free%20software/ruby/apple/mac%20m1/tamil/japan/culture/2021/02/11/rajinikanth-in-free-software.html&quot;&gt;I installed Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, actually Ruby 3.0.0, in my old systems it took 20+ seconds to generate my &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; blog, here its 3. In the above text you would have found how M1 handles 0.A.D in a cool way when other laptops fan would be screaming. As always Apple looks good, the build is solid which other makers do not offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thought&quot;&gt;Final Thought&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple sucks, no doubt about it. I am just waiting for AMD and Intel to crush M1. Will that happen or will Apple kill them at their own game is yet to be seen. I haven’t restarted my friends project yet, I am still evaluating stuff, once done will blog about Data Science on M1. I feel M1 is okay for computer pioneers, for others who can lay hands on &lt;a href=&quot;https://system76.com&quot;&gt;System 76&lt;/a&gt;, better do so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Stunning possibility in Data Science</title><link href="/2021/02/13/stunning-possibility-in-data-science.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stunning possibility in Data Science" /><published>2021-02-13T14:36:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-02-13T14:36:00+05:30</updated><id>/2021/02/13/stunning-possibility-in-data-science</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2021/02/13/stunning-possibility-in-data-science.html">&lt;table&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was 2005 I think, web development professionals were demanding US$ 10 per hour, I saw an opportunity, out of college and wounded by corporate HCL, a guy who had no idea on how to code in HTML approached real estate companies and said that their websites would be done at very cheap price. My idea was to train myself and do the code for US $ 10 per day, it worked, I had to get more people to satisfy orders. Works like people who thought like me has made websites dirt cheap today. Today I can get your website in a day, with just for $100 where most of it is my profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I see a similar chance Data Science. It’s just like web tech then. Then HTML, Ajax, Server, Domain were the terms that were cool, and people would shove money into your face if you tell these terms. Today its Data Science, Machine Learning, Big Data, Tensor flow and so on. Why they are cool? I don’t know. once upon a time Merlin Monroe was hot, people paid hug amount for anything that had that buzz word, but today? No. Today it might be Kim Kardashian, tomorrow? who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans seem to have this peculiar tendency to rate hight fo certain words at certain time. I don’‘t know the exact psychology why so, but it is so. My business model is this. I see not so much good Data Science professional say in a big company demanding salary of Rs 45 Lakhs per annum. why can’t I train people so cheap that they will challenge this guys, offer better quality code for just Rs 15 Lakhs per annum?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving down tech cost is very important. Today I type this on a machine that has no fan but has possibly 1000X the processing power of computers in 1980’s. the result, this blog will be read by 1000’s of people at dirt cheap prices. I will get more Data Science and Cloud business without relying on expensive marketing people, which in turn will translate to lower and more affordable services for 100’s of others, and so it goes. One day it would be affordable enough to own an entire star system!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Merlin Monroe</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Rajinikanth in Free Software</title><link href="/free%20software/ruby/apple/mac%20m1/tamil/japan/culture/2021/02/11/rajinikanth-in-free-software.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rajinikanth in Free Software" /><published>2021-02-11T16:03:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-02-11T16:03:00+05:30</updated><id>/free%20software/ruby/apple/mac%20m1/tamil/japan/culture/2021/02/11/rajinikanth-in-free-software</id><content type="html" xml:base="/free%20software/ruby/apple/mac%20m1/tamil/japan/culture/2021/02/11/rajinikanth-in-free-software.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/%E0%AE%9A%E0%AF%82%E0%AE%AA%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B8%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%9F%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D_%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%9C%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%A9%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%A8%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%8D_-_Actor_Rajinikanth.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajinikanth is an hero here in Tamilnadu, India. He is a hero in Japan too. He has done nothing useful but to act, but his funny and comical way of acting has attracted fans like Tom and Jerry would attract fans and his movies are great to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby’s creator Matz is Japanese, so as an Tamil I was asking him to view Rajikanth’s movie and he did :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/karthik_ak?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@karthik_ak&lt;/a&gt; I watched &amp;#39;The Robot|Enthiran&amp;#39;. It was marvelous.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Yukihiro Matsumoto (@yukihiro_matz) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz/status/720808569365397504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 15, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and that’s okay because Rajini is super famous in Japan. His film Muthu grossed more than Titanic in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I wanted to manage Ruby versions on my machine and hence tried rbenv, and it did not work. I was using Mac M1 and its a bit pain to get Ruby on it. So after lot of DuckDuckGoing pain I found this tool called asdf here &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.driftingruby.com/episodes/a-rubyist-s-apple-m1-review&quot;&gt;https://www.driftingruby.com/episodes/a-rubyist-s-apple-m1-review&lt;/a&gt;. It looked simple and it should work. But ya, we are installing Ruby 3 on rosetta instead of M1, hmmmm….. not okay, but okay. I managed to get Ruby installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then this happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;% asdf | tail
                                        environment used for command shim execution.
asdf info                               Print OS, Shell and ASDF debug information.
asdf reshim &amp;lt;name&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;            Recreate shims for version of a package
asdf shim-versions &amp;lt;command&amp;gt;            List the plugins and versions that
                                        provide a command
asdf update                             Update asdf to the latest stable release
asdf update --head                      Update asdf to the latest on the master branch

&quot;Late but latest&quot;
-- Rajinikanth
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the version of asdf I am currently using :o&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;% asdf --version
v0.8.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked the faces on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf&quot;&gt;asdf&lt;/a&gt; and found this guy &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HashNuke&quot;&gt;Akash Manohar&lt;/a&gt;, an Indian, possibly a Tamil if not Japanese :D living in Banglore.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why India should absorb Pakistan and Bangladesh?</title><link href="/geography/india/2020/10/17/why-india-should-absorb-pakistan-and-bangladesh.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why India should absorb Pakistan and Bangladesh?" /><published>2020-10-17T15:46:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-10-17T15:46:00+05:30</updated><id>/geography/india/2020/10/17/why-india-should-absorb-pakistan-and-bangladesh</id><content type="html" xml:base="/geography/india/2020/10/17/why-india-should-absorb-pakistan-and-bangladesh.html">&lt;p&gt;Why did we elect Modi as our priminister? We did not like Manmohan Singh (even though he’s a genius,) to listen to a woman of Italian origin. We have just got freedom from Brits who don’t even wash their bottoms yet, and now we have to listen to a lady who is from a similar culture. We were fed up with 2G, and other scams that plagued our nation. For people like me, if Modi came to power he would not hesitate to kill Pakistanis and integrate that state with us. He is a person who watched genocide of Muslims in his own state and feels unrepentant, I thought he would not hesitate to put an end to Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History needs Hitler like and devils. If it’s not for Winston Churchill who killed millions in India by shipping grains to Europe, England would have not won the second world war. If India needs a bloody war with Pakistan to wipe them off so that our territorial integrity is maintained, and so be it. Congress won’t do it, so we put a Satan in power. But this Satan is killing our own people who are Muslims and other lower castes in Hinduism, than killing Pakistanis and thus bringing relief to Iran, Afghanistan and us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I saw this map of India:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/indian_subcontinent.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look how well our territory is defined by mountains in North, East and West, and ocean at the bottom. And why we can’t rule this tiny land fully? Because some fucker 10,000 years ago said a God called Shiva exists? Because another fucker 1000 years ago said a God called Allah exist? Science says both are untrue! If we listen to some word of mouth things without verifying the facts how stupid we are? We must think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even today I think Persians and Afghanistan’s refer Pakistanis as Hindu’s. We are the people of Indus, the mighty river that fed and watered our forefathers before all this Muhammad and this Saffron saints existed. We had an really efficient cities, drains, brick making and industrial skills. Still the iron pillars erected by Ashoka  hasn’t rusted, Qutub Minar needs regular tending to keep it upright. That was the level of sophistication we had achieved eons ago. A might civilization was spread from Boluchistan to Tamilnadu. In fact Dravidian Civilization was spread from Iran to Srilanka eons before Ashoka ruled. We are one people, and we have lost it all because few idiots point out to few texts and say that we are different people. What a bullshit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like the United Kingdom, European Union and United States, we must form a united India that consists of Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Srilanka and Burma We may have different parliaments, governments and cultures but we can have common things like defense, space program, scientific endeavor. There will be no borders among these states, people could travel freely without restrictions, a common currency would mean a better commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ya, dream is a dream, foolish humans are foolish humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Why did we elect Modi as our priminister?
