&lt;p&gt;Its worrying, as a Tamilian its really worrying for me. Udayanidhi Stalin is taking the reigns of D.M.K youth wing. This was a party who’s chief Karunanidhi walked out a meeting when it was proposed Murasoli Maaran should be held up in high ranks, look now whats happening!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if the D.M.K people are safeguarding Tamil, just by knowing Tamil today I am unable to earn a comfortable living. The keyboard I type in has English alphabets rather than Tamil ones. Bus signs and numbers are written in English 1..2..3 than Tamil ones, no kid in Tamilnadu knows to do math with Tamil numerals. Even people of D.M.K are polyglot for survival. Kanimozhi’s school Sunshine is a English medium school than Tamil. Many Tamil families want their kids to have a English education than in Tamil. If Tamil disappears, I won’t be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing the D.M.K is doing well just like the Congress is to take care of its head family, that of Karunanidhi’s. That guy, his son and his grandson are politicians. Most of Karuna’s family are successful business people. If a Tamil wanted to have his own business, he must think a lot, he must budget, most probably he must give up that idea of having his own business and must choose to work. Even if he establishes a business, he has good chance of failing. Have you ever thought how the Karuna’s and even AIADMK families have established very successful businesses? Why their success rates are so high? Why we the people who they say they regard greater than their life have to fail and stress so much?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has a person in DMK ever thought why his son cannot become the party youth chief, but Stalin’s son can? Has AIADMK ever thought why there are many hereditary politicians in their party?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy about North India at least, Rahul is kind of no more and he quits, at least he is acting as though he does not have the power to run the congress any more. Politics and business, it must be run by people who have talent, not by some stupid just because he happens to be of some blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t feel India, Tamilnadu especially will have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Calling methods with &amp;amp; operator in Ruby</title><link href="/2019/07/02/calling-methods-with-operator-in-ruby.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Calling methods with &amp; operator in Ruby" /><published>2019-07-02T09:42:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-07-02T09:42:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/07/02/calling-methods-with-operator-in-ruby</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/07/02/calling-methods-with-operator-in-ruby.html">&lt;p&gt;Today I learned this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember when, it was a day when I bought Salem R.R Chicken Briyani and ate it, it was so good that even without my realization I ate it without any side dish. My respect for Salem R.R went through the roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next week I bought Briyani at the very same Salem R.R and I tried to eat, this time I was unable to swallow it without side dish. Compared to previous one this was crap. I am a regular buyer, and all subsequent weeks it was somewhere between crap and the good tasty one. Yesterday it came close to the good tasty one but was still far behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salem R.R is costly costs 200/- even for chicken. Though the quantity is little bit higher, it costs a bit high. For that cost they must give some justification in taste. One week its good and another its crap. I hope they hire process experts, apply some scientific management and make the taste consistent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Better Dask Than Spark</title><link href="/2019/06/25/better-dask-than-spark.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Better Dask Than Spark" /><published>2019-06-25T16:12:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-06-25T16:12:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/06/25/better-dask-than-spark</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/06/25/better-dask-than-spark.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dask.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to meddle with Data. I wanted to be a A.I guy when I was in college, but we were not allowed to take that elective, and A.I then was very different than its now. Back in 2004, 1 GB was considered a luxury, only very few carried laptops, desktops were computers then, and no iPhones then. People were having less devices that spied on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now things have changed thanks to the bullish push of Silicon foundries around the world. Price per compute has fallen like hell. Any one having right skill and slim wallet can have banks of computers working for him in minutes, we have Raspberry Pi thats so small and far powerful and far cheaper than the first computer I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;316&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CXCjpJasvG0?color=white&amp;amp;theme=light&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people who love computers, its like kid in candy store where the price of candy drops by the day. Wish I saw the same smartness and price drop in energy, health, education and food industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With computers becoming so cheap, and so much data available, what an A.I project would take months or a year, will possibly take a week or two to complete. Such has grown computer hardware and software that has run on it. Thanks to Free Software Foundation, most great softwares that are available today are affordable and do not have shackling licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for people like me, doing a A.I curiosity project is a monthly exercise than a dream. I use Python, Numpy and Scikit-learn for most of my stuff. Most of the A.I things are just looking at data, cleaning it and trying to fit it in a model and checking the accuracy of prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s get to the practical situation, we know that A.I algorithm spits out a better predicting model if it has more data to train it. So you have a toy data set in your office and you are confident the code you coded has a spit out a model that is good enough. Now your boss tells to scale, and there your smile disappears. You may be good at looking at data and making computers predict something out of it, but when it comes to scaling, nah, thats not your game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need Spark, right? I don’t think so. There is a new stuff called Dask &lt;a href=&quot;https://dask.org/&quot;&gt;https://dask.org/&lt;/a&gt; , I haven’t tried it yet, but reading this &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/spark.html&quot;&gt;https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/spark.html&lt;/a&gt; tells me its time to say goodbye to spark.
Rather than having a separate scaling up guy for your A.I project, Dask might let a Datascientist do it, and it seems to fit the normal data science workflow without adding much to the learning curve. So try it out if your project is getting bigger.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">One good thing I have done for my friends</title><link href="/2019/06/21/one-good-thing-i-have-done-for-my-friends.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="One good thing I have done for my friends" /><published>2019-06-21T13:25:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-06-21T13:25:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/06/21/one-good-thing-i-have-done-for-my-friends</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/06/21/one-good-thing-i-have-done-for-my-friends.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/chennai.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one good thing I have done for my friends in the past 2 years or more, that is to prevent many from buying a house in Chennai, and i am so proud to have saved them lot of money. Here is why you must not buy a house in Chennai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chennai is a dying city, having no water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, Chennai is a dying city. Not many people love Chennai, not many people in Chennai identify them as Chennaiites, they love their villages and towns and do not bother to maintain this city. This neglect has made lot of harm to Chennai, stray dogs, overflowing garbage, lack of good clean infra, and Chennai is always controlled by corrupt politicians and cops. This neglect and using Chennai as a money source has depleted it, now we don’t even have water here. To get back things to normal is going to take years and possibly decades. Till that time comes if you buy a home you will be spending any where between 5% - 25% of your earnings for just buying water. Is it good?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chennai has lot of water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact Chennai has lot of water. More rain rains here than that is needed by the people over here to use, but only 5% of it goes into the ground, which means 2 - 3 % only is put to real good use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of water capture can be seen every where in Chennai, even for moderate rains the roads will be flooded and traffic will be jammed. The government is waste and is comprised only of looters, but what about the people? Can’t they do something about it? No, never. Imagine how much of a fool the people need to be to elect such a foolish looters as our rulers. I never think Chennai people will have sufficient intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only if Chennai turns to dust, and some intelligent beings start to settle here that can really think, will this place prosper again. I feel its only a matter of time that Chennai becomes a dead city.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">AN-32 Crash, Where is my tax money?</title><link href="/2019/06/06/an-32-crash-where-is-my-tax-money.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AN-32 Crash, Where is my tax money?" /><published>2019-06-06T21:49:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-06-06T21:49:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/06/06/an-32-crash-where-is-my-tax-money</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/06/06/an-32-crash-where-is-my-tax-money.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.pinimg.com/736x/93/85/73/938573ade83be39210e1c8585599333d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, another military plane crash in India. Our planes are not maintained, some how Narendra Modi’s, Amit Shaha’s, Rahul Gandhi’s planes are in tiptop condition and never crash. Imagine how good our nation would be if law of nature crashes politicians vehicle when ever he or she tells a lie. There wouldn’t be enough vehicles left in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AN-32 crash sends a message to Pakistan too. They must realise that Indian government kills more Indian solders than its terrorist does. So it must shift its strategy to become more effective. Perhaps it can do us more harm if it funds our political parties than funding Madrasas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have always heard this, that our army is capable of dealing with any kind of invasion. Well, good, that means we must in a great, well oiled condition, but are we? Wonder where all those money that we pay for the military goes? Some how we don’t even know the Rafel prices, even though its our money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I saw the movie “The Accidental Priminister”, well thats how I spell it :). It was good, wonder why congress supporters don’t like it? Don’t they think that it would be good for Congress and nation if the party does not cater to a single family and caters to people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this movie they say Manmohan Singh is just a jaalra to Sonia Gandhi. I believe it’s true. Indira Gandhi was a jaalara to the Soviets, Narasima Rao was a jaalar to the USA. Vajpyee was a jaalara to communal forces and the RSS and so does Modi follows in his footsteps (Vajpyeee did not have the opportunity to commit a genocide though). All our leaders were jaalara to something. So I don’t think its really says bad about Manmohan Singh. He was doing what many so called leaders of our nation did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One good thing is Sanjaya Banu wrote a book about Manmohan, imagine if some had wrote a book exposing Modi, (s)he would have been named Anti Indian, either he and his family should have fled India or would have disappeared or would have been killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So showing Manmohan as jaalara, a truth coming out about a gentleman was not a surprise for me. What I noticed was the movies accuracy of star casting and how they portrayed the PMO and Sonia’s house in detail. Here I am in Sithalapakkam, worrying about my water supply, worrying whether it would be cost effective to turn on my A/C to quench the sweltering heat, worrying about whether to give my car for repair or not, having no clue how will I be 25 years from now, or will I exist 25 years from now? Or before I die will I live in a house that stands besides a tar road. I don’t have water, clean air, future is doubtful, yet the opulence with which these servants of mine who eat my tax money live with stunned me. The parties they attend are top class and they don’t pay for it. Its free for them :(.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure none in power ever sweats or feels cold, they are been cooled and heated by our sweat and blood. The infrastructure they enjoy is like a five seven service every day. I think their medicine too is free. That would explain why many old guys stick to power. While we citizens wait for busses under direct sun, they travel in convoys in nice and cozy environment. Thats what I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder what makes a Indian accept that a Priminister or President who is our mere servant can have a unrealistic better life than us which we cannot even imagine? Or is it that I am the one who just thinks and all are dumb?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">India under Nazi Rule</title><link href="/2019/05/23/india-under-nazi-rule.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="India under Nazi Rule" /><published>2019-05-23T18:20:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-05-23T18:20:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/05/23/india-under-nazi-rule</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/05/23/india-under-nazi-rule.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/anj/hitler-modi/359878701.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the BJP has won. I wonder weather there will be another central government election in India. Or whether we will spiral into wars defeating our neighbours and so a leader who will be our warlord will rule our country forever? Let’s see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For beef lovers, the days are done. I think its time for them to quit India and go to a liberal nation. There is no guarantee that there would be no lynching and killing of people who love to eat beef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any one who questions the government will be called an Anti-Indian, would be put into trouble by government officials and would be jailed, poisoned there and if they are still not yielding they would disappear. For example loot at the fate of Piyush Manush, he is been tortured now and then, Thirumurugan Gandhi is poisoned, and Mugilan has disappeared, most probably he has been killed in a brutal way, who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was looking at the behaviour of Modi, his behaviour and that of Adolf Hitler are very similar. Let me tell you waht I found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both Hitler and Modi started from humble beginnings. Hitler was a simple solder, a painter dreaming big for his nation and Modi was working in a tea shop.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both Modi and Hitler love their nation. Thats unquestionable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both have a strong feeling that what they think and do is the right thing for the nation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both don’t listen to intellectuals around them, take for instance the demonetisation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both are narcissist and, love do grand things so that people praise them. They want for their names to be eternal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both have high self discipline and are relatively uncorrupt.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hitler had Himler with him and Modi has Amit Shah.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both Nazi party and BJP has a violent and ultra nationalist wing attached with it, for Nazi’s its the SS, for BJP its the RSS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both have a reason to hit at neighbours. For the Nazi’s its the greatness of Germany. Here I strongly suspect how there could be a bomb blast in Pulwama if we have strong Chowkidars who guard the nation. Or they are Chowkidars for name sake and are real dummies?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modi is loved by international committee and so was Hitler, until the day realised his true intentions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both Hitler and Modi have got the reputation of manipulating governments data. Modi is a economic debacle, so he has told statisticians to manipulate data so that the economy looks good. Hitler manipulated government economic data too. Almost none in public knew the money spent for killing jews. But under Hitler, economy improved, under Modi it slides down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The press in Nazi Germany was highly controlled by the Nazi party, and so is the same case in India. Watch the news channels, there would always be a pro Modi news that has no substance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Freedom of expression was highly controlled.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Take for instance women trying to enter Aiyappan, God is equal to all, but they are still been denied the right despite the court ruling in favour of them.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Take for instance the killing of Gauri Lankesh and how the case is still unsolved.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In Tamilnadu take for instance ruining of the life of Perumal Murugan by Hindu’s.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lets see what the future holds. I feel Modi’s brain and attitude is on a knife edge he could be just a normal PM and he could be a psycho like Hitler. Unlike Vajpyee and like Hitler he has no patience and self control and could let loose. In fact Modi has done it, in Nazi Germany Jews were persecuted and in Modi Gujarat Muslims were slain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this land, miracles have happened, Chand Ahoka became Ashoka The Great, Alexanders Violent push to rule the Earth came to an end, we defeated the greatest empire at that time (ruled by Winston Chruchill, a blood thirsty Englishman who starved us to death) without firing a shot. Lets see whether this land would go into dark ruins because of this mad man called Modi and his Hindu clan, or lets see whether our soil turns him into nice one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
