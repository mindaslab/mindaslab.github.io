      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeiggh6kgdwow4pkfslceprmbo47zm3cbrmpgpvswchpay6xkz4ouqm.ipfs.dweb.link/PM-Narendra-Modi-and-HH-Chinna-Jeeyar-Swami-attending-the-Puja-ceremony-at-the-Statue-of-Equality-worlds-largest-sitting-metal-statue-in-Hyderabad-by-PM-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Modi offering to Ramanujan statue&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modi recently inaugurated a statue of Saint Ramunajan,  Ramanujan is a well known Vaishnavite saint in south India. I am not worried what underwear Modi wears, or if he wears it or not, its his personal stuff, but if he exposes his personal stuff to India it looks ugly. Ones religion is personal stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wondered how the leaders of India (I don’t consider Modi as a leader), tried to open peoples minds. Take for instance Nehru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Jnehru.jpg/501px-Jnehru.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Jawaharlal Nehru&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I duckduckgoed about Nehru inaugurations, I found these pictures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeieyitmhrybyyv3efzmtudzzi2got4q6dlnyba7cjpfxtpwomebq4i.ipfs.dweb.link/nehru-opens-dam.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Nehru opens a dam&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above one is a picture of Nehru opening a dam, and the below one is Nehru with Vickram Sarabhai, the man who was instrumental in creating ISRO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeif5mkte2fkciwf47kxj4sufnmf3ykpcfzzmujo7a35eev6uu7m6wu.ipfs.dweb.link/131080-jcrgwwvakb-1605276168.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Nehru with Vickram Sarabhai&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nehru opened institutions and infrastructure that improved lives of people, that used Science &amp;amp; Technology to seek and find out mysteries of this universe or possibly multiverse. He was intelligent and never would want to fool people by associating with a particular religion. He made sure that he never promoted God, thus fooling people to think God exists. He might or might not have belived in God, but he made sure he never made a fool of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;congress-lost&quot;&gt;Congress Lost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress started as a religious party, it was they who pioneered bringing idol of lord Ganesh to roads. They knew religion is a powerful force. But then somehow something good happened, congress got bright minds and an air of secularism settled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then look at congress now, below you can see a picture of Manmohan and Sonia Gandhi paying respect to Saiababa’s dead body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeibrsbypjatdxfxzvpgszijjoutrgvevk55iqp25rcfgphb7wzkary.ipfs.dweb.link/del473378.webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Manmohan and Sonia Gandhi paying respect to Saiababa’s dead body&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did congress get lost? I am not sure. Where it’s intellectual’s went? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact Saibaba is a mere magician who used his tricks to deceive people that he had grace of God. If God really exists, why it would give grace to one or two and not all? May be God believers don’t have brains enough to think like that and hence most people will never think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the opposition is weak, and can’t hold up to it’s moral values, I wonder how they can question Modi?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;india-a-nation-of-science-or-just-a-hindu-pakistan&quot;&gt;India a nation of Science or just a Hindu Pakistan?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Pakistan a nation destroyed by Islam&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is a religious nation that does not want to develop. We are Indian’s, we created our nation to be secular, its up to us to choose the right leader. Do we want our kids life’s to be better, and do we want Science, Knowledge, progress, this giving us happy and comfortable life? Or dow we want to be just another Hindu Pakistan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember Pakistan is a nation that is currently a burden to this planet and nothing else because they will never improve because of their religion. One must remember that Nepal and Bangladesh have shed their religions and have modernized.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Modi offering to Ramanujan statue</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Getting Clojupyter running</title><link href="/programming/clojure/clojupyter/2022/02/04/getting-clojupyter-running.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Getting Clojupyter running" /><published>2022-02-04T11:48:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-02-04T11:48:00+05:30</updated><id>/programming/clojure/clojupyter/2022/02/04/getting-clojupyter-running</id><content type="html" xml:base="/programming/clojure/clojupyter/2022/02/04/getting-clojupyter-running.html">&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many programmers I fell in love with Clojure. Before I fell in love with Ruby and this framework Ruby on Rails, but when I worked in companies like a big corp , I encountered Rails apps with 0.2 million lines of code, having no test, thus practically unmaintainable, my boss was finding scapegoats to blame and was firing people. To mitigate the slow development speeds, a project that could have been done with 3 - 5 people had kind of 10+ developers, a dozen or so testers, and huge ops team! Yes that’s right. Ruby on Rails was supposed be a cost effective framework which few people could use to create great apps, but here they used lot of people to create a waste and muddled app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I desperately wanted a maintainable code and I landed up on Clojure and I am learning it. One advantage of Clojure is, if you know it well, you can use ClojureScript instead of JavaScript. Framework like Ruby on Rails does not promise you out of the box that you can replace JavaScript, JavaScript an ill made up language that gives pain to developers, and hence should be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with Clojure using Clojupyter that runs on Jupyter notebook, and it was very good. It’s like REPL on steroids. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter/blob/master/doc/conda-installing.md#using-conda-installing-clojupyter&quot;&gt;installed it with conda&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems to work all well. Than I got this error all of a sudden:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been very long since I worked with Java and I couldn’t find head or tail of it. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://clojureverse.org/t/unable-to-work-with-clojupyter/8554&quot;&gt;asked it in ClojureVerse&lt;/a&gt;, none responded. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter/issues/159&quot;&gt;put it in Clojupyter github&lt;/a&gt;, and none responded. I was bit desperate, here was a language that seemed to be good, and it could harness the power of Jupyter, so learning could be fast, but I wasn’t getting enough help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a Rubyist, the Ruby community is very good, you get response in your emails if you poat a problems, perhaps that’s not the case yet with Clojure community, that’s sad. I wish it improves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter/issues/159&quot;&gt;used Clojupyter as library&lt;/a&gt; and it worked! I hope it doesnt’t screw up. First I got something like zeqomq error, but then when I did &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;conda upgrade ipykernel&lt;/code&gt;, it got fixed. I got a help from &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitanswer.com/spyder-error-tornado-general-uncaught-exception-in-zmqstream-callback-306179886&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now I am okay, but it would be great if clojure community is becomes more helpful in the future. Right now I feel barrier for entry into Clojure, despite the language’s simplicity is high.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Clojupyter Logo</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">When Devise sign_in, sign_up does not work with RSpec request spec</title><link href="/web%20development/ruby%20on%20rails/devise/tdd/rspec/2022/01/28/when-devise-sign-in-sign-up-does-not-work-with-rspec-request-spec.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="When Devise sign_in, sign_up does not work with RSpec request spec" /><published>2022-01-28T20:46:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-01-28T20:46:00+05:30</updated><id>/web%20development/ruby%20on%20rails/devise/tdd/rspec/2022/01/28/when-devise-sign-in-sign-up-does-not-work-with-rspec-request-spec</id><content type="html" xml:base="/web%20development/ruby%20on%20rails/devise/tdd/rspec/2022/01/28/when-devise-sign-in-sign-up-does-not-work-with-rspec-request-spec.html">&lt;p&gt;I was updating a Rails 6 project, there were som technical debt, I needed to remove or make failing tests pass.

So in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;spec/rails_helper.rb&lt;/code&gt;, add the following lines after &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;require &apos;rspec/rails&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;RSpec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Devise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ControllerHelpers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;type: :controller&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Devise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ControllerHelpers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;type: :view&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Devise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;IntegrationHelpers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;type: :request&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it should work fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thing you must note is this line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Devise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;IntegrationHelpers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;type: :request&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where we make &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IntegrationHelpers&lt;/code&gt; available in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; spec.&lt;/p&gt;

Before that I have been an embedded systems programmer, to code a microcontroller and not knowing what its really intended for was a wreak on my soul. I am a guy who though belies there is no purpose in life, nothing is constant, and everything is meaningless, strangely seek for a purpose of my actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left big corporates, and not knowing what HTML is, I stated creating websites for people and businesses, and I was successful. People said there is a miracle stuff called PHP, and I am just using plain HTML to create websites, I learned PHP and it improved my productivity a lot. I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I came to know about this programming language called Ruby, I tried it out. Boy I was blown away. I thought PHP was super productive compared to C and Java, but Ruby was not even next, it was way way way far ahead. There was this framework Ruby on Rails, I failed to learn it many times, but eventually I mastered it. It immensely increased my productivity, a months job in PHP was just day in Ruby on Rails!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails before Version 4 also eliminated a pain point, it was called JavaScript. A very poorly designed language (and it’s still poorly designed), it was pain to use. Rails people built a  wonderful library called Prototype and Scriptaculous, and they wrote a Ruby wrapper called Rails Java Script which encapsulated the dirtiness of JavaScript. It was all great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came in jQuery, it was JavaScript-ish which made us shed tears but Rails also included Coffeescript, which removed some pain of writing JavaScript. Though Rails was bit rotting away from its promise, it was okay because of Coffeescript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then for some reason around Rails 6 Cofeescript was kind of stopped working, currently I am using jQuery and vanilla JavaScript to write my front end, and it bit sucks. Plus I have to deal with all this webpacker comedy which makes app development immensely complex!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rails 7 I guess webpacker and nodejs are kind of pushed away and people say its good, but I am still trialing out before I recommend it to my customers. Rails still advocates using JavaScript, which frankly sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am exploring Clojure and ClojureScript, just to escape the menace of creating apps using JavaScript. I was also attracted to Microsoft’s Blazor framework where we can code everything with C#, but then which one having brains will ever trust Microsoft?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one area I have missed exploring or to be frank haven’t explored because it seems not to integrate with Rails well is Opal. I truly wished Rails embraced Opal, and we need not touch JavaScript ever again, but then for some reason it did not happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;

    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rxlJRydqmk8?color=white&amp;amp;theme=light&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/iframe&gt;
     &lt;/figure&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any way let me come to the point of this blog. I want to tell the world why I think its super silly to have a JavaScript framework. Well here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeicoq5sm36a62eqzxzzotv25mlshgi4sxqauiknnpancvkjuw66g7u.ipfs.dweb.link/silliness-of-js-framework-Page-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We store data mostly in  a system called RDBMS, and its major role is store, and retrieve data thats all. It was created to be very efficient for that. It wasn’t created to generate a HTML document that could be served as web page, plus it’s not created to be immensely secure. One wrong query could destroy an entire app and the Database. So we have this red thing in middle called the Web Framework that makes sure that some user action won’t trigger a query that destroys the business, and it retrieves data from the browser, stores it in the DB and get’s the data from the DB, generates a HTML and sends it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeifkayqteg26g4ayrtlsrwax7a5tzuwsvgyp6243oqoq7ftyplar6a.ipfs.dweb.link/silliness-of-js-framework-Page-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now look at the above picture, you have inserted a JavaScript framework in between and you send JSON back and forth to the web framework and JavaScript framework converts to HTML. That kind of sucks. You are adding an extra layer just for nothing! That to me is really really stupid and could be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-big-tech-promotes-this-approach&quot;&gt;Why big tech promotes this approach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In big tech, what looks good on paper, getting approvals from various levels for your idea, a tech guy looking good on paper and his survival is important than solving problems that humans face. So they tend to do what looks good on paper. Look at the diagram below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeibb3qpo7z3ewspq7us5spphblc5rmusupatzvg42lcoj6lu4po3fm.ipfs.dweb.link/silliness-of-js-framework-Big-Tech-Arch.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see a nice front end, a nice back end and they are connected by JSON. The front end could be a mobile or  website running on a desktop, the back end could be written in any language and they are connected by this JSON which provides good abstraction. On paper this looks clean. For an inexperienced it looks good. So they get this stuff approved. They claim it’s an innovative way of doing things. Since they are big tech, they can afford to develop new front end frameworks which suits their thought at that time. They could hire big teams who would take care of front end, back end, a team to look at the architecture and synchronization between them and can handle all such complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now consider us, most of the tech guys who service clients. Now think, are we here to solve some ones problems with tech or spend multiple millions on advertising saying that we are on the bleeding edge? Think if we have the man power or the money to pay big teams which can take on this architecture? Think is it worth the effort to convert website data to JSON to Database rows and vice versa?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most tech people think what’s been done in big tech is right because big tech has more money. Why don’t they think big tech has more money and hence they can afford to be inefficient? Most developers fall into this trap, they learn some front end framework, they put it on their resume so that it looks cool, and their life follows resume driven development approach to their grave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s for you to ask yourself, did you become a tech guy to solve peoples problems using tech? Or are you here just because you are here and are okay to go with what ever is thrown at you?&lt;/p&gt;

Call me what ever you want, but just give my pay was my motto and I worked. In truth we all work for money, those who say they don’t, cut their salary and see how long would they last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now coming to names of positions in teams, there are these junior developer, developer, senior developer, tech lead, project lead, tech architect and so on. In this company where I was hired they the name tech architects and rebranded themselves as principal engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let me tell you a a secret about the I.T industry. Why we have so many levels and positions? The reason is simple. The up you go the level, the less you code and more you talk. Software development is like a war, in war the lower ranks fight and die, where’s the upper ranks talk, thats exactly what happens in the I.T industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make those talkers sound cool, before we had names like Project Lead, but that exposed stuff, there was no funky technical word in it, so it became Tech Lead, to make more techie it became Tech Architect (a position I hold in most of the companies), now people know that Tech Architect do nothing but eat Biriyani and Samosas and now they call themselves as Principal Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically we are close to the management, we do politics and intimidate people and draw huge salaries on others mind breaking work. I will write another blog what a tech architect must really do, but this is a blog to save the current tech architects and Principal Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I have seen in most companies is these Tech Architects and Principal Engineers increase the complexity of the project so that their work looks more relevant. For example I am a Ruby on Rails consultant, that framework has excellent front end stuff, but these tech architect use Vue, React, and Angular (God evil does exist in this universe) and make the app look more complex so that they can talk a lot about it, have a bigger team and prove to others they can manage lot of people even though the entire project could be be done with a small team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing they do is to obey the management and lick its feet for survival, create tickets with tight deadlines and put pressure on developer’s. In most companies, these people are just hollow pipes, they convey message from client and management to developers and back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now the truth about Tech Architects and Principal Engineers getting revealed slowly from this blog on, what should we call next to protect our high salaries? I recommend &lt;strong&gt;Code Mechanics&lt;/strong&gt;. We are the great guys who mend the stale code created by ignorant developers. How the ignorant developer get into the team despite our watch is an issue that must be hushed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have given you guys a new name to put in your resume, draw higher salaries for bit more longer by cheating the tech industry. Be grateful to me and enjoy life!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I was working in a company, they had hired me knowing that I worked as a Tech Architect in my previous company, in the new company they did not call me a tech architect because they said they hated that name, because say tech architects do almost nothing, instead I was just a Ruby on Rails developer.

The power used to go off in office and we go to the backyard of the company where there was a small garden and chill out, ask about one another, make jokes and have fun. Sometimes we go to a  tea shop and have a sip and snacks. None thought any thing bad about us. The bosses knew to manage a tech team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today when we have power cuts, I get only negative feelings and remember a company I consulted. I was consulting for a company for Ruby on Rails, apparently they had messed up with such a beautiful framework and made it difficult to code. That’s excusable, but their micro services were poorly documented. That too was excusable if people were given proper time to fix documentation and code, but the boss seems to be an asshole. He wanted us to clock 12+ hours for his personal profits, and wanted us to code off tickets in a jiffy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me being a senior, and that guy having no idea how to develop a software, and wouldn’t listen to me, he expected me to code like devil, despite all those shortcomings, code I did, understanding their system I did, but if you change the framework so much, it’s not easy to understand unless you have proper documentation. They had unrealistic date estimate and I slipped often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s DMK rule now in Tamilnadu, and in DMK rule power cuts do happen, and it did happen. This made me slip more, when ever there was power cut I promptly informed my boss, but that guy seems to be an asshole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was covid peak season then, we allowed none in our home, but that guy insisted that I installed power backup for eight hours in my home, of course he won’t give any financial assistance for that, but he wanted it. He kept insisting that even though I kept saying there were old people in my home who are potential targets for Covid. In short that guy wasn’t bothered about me, my well being, my family’s well being, all he wanted was me to slave for him continuously for over 12 hours a day. It was hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to me joining he seems to have created more hell for his employees. Since he always suspected them, he made employees turn on their Zoom cameras from 2PM to 4PM and they have be be present on Zoom and code at the same time. I was shocked to hear this from my colleague. Another girl told me that he limited her lunch time to 30 minutes, I couldn’t take it. I couldn’t work under such a boss. That company had a bad HR too, one guy wanted to leave and the H.R abused him saying: ‘you are not working well here, how do you think you will work well in another company?’. To be frank that guy who left seemed to be the brightest person to me, he was not a yes boss person, may be that was his mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working there spoiled my health so much that I had to quit. They promised me to send a reliving letter in email and they haven’t done it for six months and I simply don’t like to ask them. I honestly feel these type of sadist bosses can never be fixed, only their death can give relief to the I.T industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it does pains, you do work with all your heart even though you get abused a bit, you love to code, so you do and the abuse builds up to such an extent its unbearable. When ever there is power cut I get reminded of this company and this boss, and the memory is not sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-manage-software&quot;&gt;How to manage software&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a very simple strategy to mitigate misestimation of software tickets, and it’s super simple, its called noestimate. That is you simply won’t estimate ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would show a ticket to a member in a team and will tell them to progress on it, you will track the progress and communicate with client. But even with decades of software experience people fall into the trap thinking that brain work is like repetitive brawn work and try to estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say I.T industry has got very bright people, but I am sure thats a myth, its got many people who do not know how to run project, and people who don’t know how to manage discrepancies and delays, all they do is to put pressure on people who really work. Those ind of are still stuck in the era of industrial age and never taken time to think about age of thought and knowledge. I feel nothing could be done about those brains that can’t think about how other brains think.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">There was time when I was an intern in a company back in 2002, we were coding for ABB PLC and all those stuff.

&lt;p&gt;Some how Buddhism seems to be the only religion that has cracked the psychology aspect of religion. We pray to God for want, want of something. It could be a material want or an emotional/psychological want. That is we desire for something. This desire is the cause of unhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you say you do not desire happiness and sadness, you do not desire wealth and poverty, you do not desire life and death, you just realize nothing is constant and everything is meaningless, then prayer to something that claims would give you these things become immaterial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For argument sake let’s assume that there is God, that God could control you only if you want something from him, if you want nothing from anyone, then it does not matter if something exists or does not exists. It does not matter if something happens or does not happen. You simply have realized the ultimate truth that nothing is constant and everything is meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;buddhism-is-not-a-religion&quot;&gt;Buddhism is not a religion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One must know that Buddhism is not a religion. Today there are many forms of Buddhism that’s not Buddhism at all. That is many forms of Buddhism explains that our suffering is because of our karma. In truth what is suffering and happiness if nothing is constant and everything is meaningless?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no previous or next births for karma to carry over. Buddha or Buddhists might have got that thing wrong. You can’t mistake them. Tools of thought at that time were not advanced enough to verify about soul, birth, incarnation and so on. But if you are a Buddhist (a seeker of knowledge and understanding), you must update yourself and throw away the old and bring in the new.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Time highlights inequality in India</title><link href="/2021/12/11/time-highlights-inequality-in-india.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Time highlights inequality in India" /><published>2021-12-11T10:17:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-12-11T10:17:00+05:30</updated><id>/2021/12/11/time-highlights-inequality-in-india</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2021/12/11/time-highlights-inequality-in-india.html">&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few days ago Indian army killed some Naga people, some where around dozen of them I think. It is said that the army was combing to find some terrorists, they tried to stop a vehicle that they want to inspect, when it did not stop, it was fired upon, and about a dozen got killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think just a day after that, India’s Chief of Defense Staff, his name was Bipin Rawat, climbed into an helicopter, was going via Kodai-kaanal (a place where there is no summer) to a  army training  base, when his helicopter seems to have been stopped by a jack fruit tree. The helicopter tried to push ahead, but it fell down, and all the people in it was fired upon by laws of physics. I think 14 died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing here is the 14 army people were honored with gun salutes and were honored like national hero’s and were cremated, buried etc, but I think the dozen or so Nagas were not announced that they too are hero’s who lost their lives in India’s fight against terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason civilians who died in Taj Hotel attacks by Pakistani terrorist are considered heroes, but not the Nagas. News showed the crying children of Indian army people, but we do not even know if the Nagas who died had a family. We do not know if they had a good life before death, and we won’t know if their loved ones will have a decent life in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a Nagas life is worth just 5 Lakhs. May be in the future we will have advertisement in papers where if one pays Rs 5 Lakhs (it could be more due to high inflation), one could kill a Naga as trophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has the government not treated Nagas like they treated Bipin Rawat? Or is the media is not covering the honored death of Nagas with 21 gun salute, where the president and prime minister visited and performed last rites? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Your browser does not support the video element.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Kerala Muslims should stop spitting on food</title><link href="/india/food/kerala/islam/halal/2021/12/02/kerala-muslims-should-stop-spitting-on-food.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kerala Muslims should stop spitting on food" /><published>2021-12-02T09:28:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-12-02T09:28:00+05:30</updated><id>/india/food/kerala/islam/halal/2021/12/02/kerala-muslims-should-stop-spitting-on-food</id><content type="html" xml:base="/india/food/kerala/islam/halal/2021/12/02/kerala-muslims-should-stop-spitting-on-food.html">&lt;p&gt;A month back I think I saw this video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It shows a man either spitting or blowing on food. I had been to this state Kerala where I did eat and enjoy the food there, but after seeing this video I almost threw up. It is said that certain kind of Muslims in Kerala spit on their food to purify it and they also run large number of hotels. Yak. Yukeee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later it was revealed in some investigation that it was true that Muslims there consider spitting on food makes it Halal (that is Arabic for edible), and so they do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sent a media storm and finally now it looks like netizens in Kerala want to compile or are compiling a list of hotel’s where they don’t spit on food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I think the damage has already been done. I don’t think I will ever go to Kerala again. I wonder if its God’s country or spitters country. I wonder what worst practices they still hide and that are not known to the outside world for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is facing the worst because of religion. Our country is divided into three, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh solely because of religion. We have a religious government called the BJP, headed by a fanatic Narendra Modi, who is controlled by a terror outfit called the RSS which is hell bent on making India into just another Hindu Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China has given up religion and has emerged top of the world, Bangladesh has shed its Islamic identity and has raced ahead of India in per-capita GDP, we are following religion and are going back to the stone ages. It’s really stupid and sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Islam should refine, Quoran is 1000 years old may be, and what was okay then may not be okay now. I am sure all my Muslim won’t eat food that’s spit on it. Who ever these people are, even if they had to go to hell after death if they don’t spit, then they must say to their God: “so be it, I am not afraid of your hell and pain and suffering you will give to me”, and they must stop spitting on food. It’s disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A month back I think I saw this video:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">தீதும் நன்றும் பிறர் தர வாரா</title><link href="/2021/11/28/%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%80%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%A8%E0%AE%A9%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B1%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B1%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%B0-%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BE.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="தீதும் நன்றும் பிறர் தர வாரா" /><published>2021-11-28T11:29:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-11-28T11:29:00+05:30</updated><id>/2021/11/28/%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%80%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%A8%E0%AE%A9%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B1%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B1%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%B0-%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BE</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2021/11/28/%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%80%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%A8%E0%AE%A9%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B1%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B1%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%B0-%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BE.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;subtle-tone&quot;&gt;Subtle Tone&lt;/h1&gt;
