The germ of Mind As Lab’s idea started in my mind may be when I was in 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, we have been able to place excellent minds into tech Industry since it started operation from 2005. I have worked in Mind As Lab, and have been its observer. Currently, I observe it more. I get consulted for big decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was this webpage tweaks recently, anf I noticed this logo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafkreiegwxqgtjvt32454bxnwjvdrz7xgg76u4vqpcsegmngxgsz47mmhu.ipfs.nftstorage.link/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, damn I said to me, this was our previous logo, but since it’s a democratic company, the one above won the vote, the one which I saw getting designed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeibgy45edzopr3ncx56o74iowjtuh7cfo3czmxbhb2aqrv5q65vvla.ipfs.dweb.link/mind%20as%20lab%20logo%207.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;got thrown out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new logo resembles an electric bulb. What bothers me is I worked for two companies that were obsessed with this bulb thing on there webpage, technologically these companies were junk and were driven by emotions of their leadership and never a scientific process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first company was Zanec, look at their webpage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://nftstorage.link/ipfs/bafybeiga4l2lpx6zf6qnipqvxg4cb3t63vy2tpedrm6s5ak5wa3umixdxe&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a bloody bulb. The leadership of this company will never listen to tech and science and they are management kind of people, they need to be selling bottled water like John Sculley to be really successful and never tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next company was Trumatics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://nftstorage.link/ipfs/bafybeibrdcg7rphbjrdea3su7cedhcto42horqbwr7um7phca5gb5as7oy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was Trumatics director for a short period, thankfully I left, and we joke that people picked by Mind As Lab can make more money than Trumatics, and possibly 5 or 6 of them can match and outperform Zanec. But yes, success is never equals technical perfection. Technically perfect person in right environment has higher probability of success. I must also say that I don’t have revenue data of these companies, and I don’t have revenue data of Mind As Lab, it’s just a guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in these three companies, I can guarantee that a good and honest tech guy can never be successful in Trumatics and Zanec, his chances of success are more probable in Mind As Lab. But yes, since everything changes, I advise the people of Mind As Lab be vigilant and thoughtful so that C-players do not dominate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their tech people are so deprived and mentally drained by the management, Mind As Lab wouldn’t even consider making a deal with them. But yes, I’m just an observer of Mind As Lab, I can only advise it to make deal with tech companies, and not tech bogus ones. If some management guy becomes leader of Mind As Lab, not even God can save it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that irks me is, these tech bogus companies have bulb as logo, and so does Mind As Lab (for now), I wish the first company created by me never becomes tech bogus one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I don’t know what’s happening in my life.

Nothing wrong had been done technically but here is guy losing his mind. The company did not have enough revenue, or he was trying to cut me out of his firm, I was not sure what’s the real reason. He named it True Mathematics (something like that) because it was supposed be a well oiled Data Science company, but now like every one he survives by offering some Sales Force solutions I think. Even people who worked under me earn more than his entire office that too just by coding from bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was once prompted by my friend about vector Data Base, I analyzed it and thought won’t it be great if we there are only $x$ number of vector operations, and we can store large volumes of data on a single silicon, why can’t we have databases baked into FPGA’s and chips and connected to cloud, this will make stuff efficient. My friend studied with me in college, I studied Electronics &amp;amp; communication, and he Computer Science. I was trying to bake idea for a startup into his mind so that I can use his office to get a patent, where we can stipulate vector processors and sell the IP’s to interested companies, and to my dismay I found out that my friend who is a qualified engineer did not know about VHDL, FPGA and so on. It was like visiting a doctor who just knows to prescribe medicine for fever and never knew about Covid, Nipah and so on. ‘I just know about Python and Java’ said my friend (or something similar to it), and it stunned me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was put into a college that was started by an illegal liquor seller, I still fume about how crappy education was and lament to my friends, but to my friends the college was great even though all it did was to train us to be “yes boss” person than to be thinkers. I was stunned my friends accepted this fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seem to be a divide between people, people seem to either seek perfection or survival as their value, in real life its fuzzy. In real life I do use technologies that I would never use for my startup because I am paid to use, I do not open my mouth at work because my strong opinions could burn bridges, I kill animals and eat it though I know it causes pain and suffering, but at my core I seek perfection. What hurts me from decades before, or one or two jobs before makes me seek a better way of coding, better way of managing projects, better way of talking tech to younglings, to coach people and so on, but for many people just survival seems to be their core value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For survivors its just making ends meet till the month end, putting up a great show before friends and relatives in a function, sharing statuses that are void and bogus, and just carrying on with life and not seeking truth, in fact to live in the comfort of ignorance seem to be the value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recent days I did have very low value about people who did not seek perfection. I considered God believers, drunks, smokers, drug takers, corrupt, rapist, survivors as very low people, but then wait, I began to think about my friend’s history. Have I gone hungry like them? Have I been in deep financial trouble like them? Do I have people in my family who make my life hell? Do I stay in a job which has bad boss? Has any tragedy ever struck me? Am I surrounded by foxes and jackals? The answer is no for all questions. But these people have faced it, and some are facing it. To face it and to survive in it and if lucky they have come out of it is itself a great achievement, this traumatized soul of theirs think its better just to survive and not to fall into abyss. For me having not worrying about many problems in life has opened my mind to seek what’s next and what’s perfect. May be if I faced problems like them, maybe I would be a corrupt, a drunk, a mere survivor who just lets time pass by without seeking perfection. Maybe I would be far worst psychopath than others when troubled, who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to cultivate more of an Ubuntu way of thought to understand about the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">‘You don’t care about family, you know nothing about people who have family’ was the kind of words I heard from a guy whose company I was a director of, I was shocked.

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Duraimurugan - minister of water (Tamilnadu)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to thank Duraimurugan, the way he handles Karnataka now, he is not talking with them, he is saying things will be taken care in the court. This has stunned that state which was and is conning us in case of Kaveri water issue for ages. In fact our neighboring states are using Tamilnadu as a mere sewage dump and storm water drain. Because we are part of India we are unable to report this in U.N, or take India to the court of justice international.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near future, water is going to be really scarce, and water politics is going to peak. Our neighbors are going to use this as a political weapon to bully us. As a Tamil think, should we allow this to happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think independence for Tamilnadu is going to happen any time soon, and if we get independent, imaging how the political dynasties will treat us and imaging how many of us will be in prison, murdered and so on. I guess independent Tamilnadu will become a kind of dictator state or something since will have no higher power looking upon corrupt Tamil politicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case of water issue, Tamilnadu has been true to India, while India has betrayed us repeatedly, we must get water independence at all cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have plenty of solar energy in our coast, why can’t Tamilnadu government establish solar-powered water desalination plants? This might take care of some costal water needs. We need to make sure all our rain water is stored, none should be let out into the sea without proper use. We must encourage reclamation used of water in homes. Say what water drains of a sink can be purified a bit and be used in flushes. Homes could install urinals for men which needs less water to flush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capturing water from air is another option, with huge coastline, moist air does travel inwards into Tamilnadu, we can fund businesses that sell devices that will condense this moisture to liquid water. These devices could be made mandatory in new homes built in Tamilnadu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we need to talk hard with center and build dozens of nuclear reactors which will supply ample power, this power should be used to desalinate water in coast and pumped back to farms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all this to happen we Tamils should form relationships with nations that have done good R&amp;amp;D in water management like Israel, Libya etc. We must invite great scientists and form a water research institute to perfect technology and stay ahead of global warming. May b e we can contribute back to India which has betrayed us for so long, thus proving we are more Gandhian than Indians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water independence is every Tamil’s birth right, and we should have it! I’m saying this fingers crossed as our corruption levels are enormous.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Duraimurugan - minister of water (Tamilnadu)</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Slaves want to be slaves</title><link href="/2023/08/15/slaves-want-to-be-slaves.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Slaves want to be slaves" /><published>2023-08-15T23:48:00+05:30</published><updated>2023-08-15T23:48:00+05:30</updated><id>/2023/08/15/slaves-want-to-be-slaves</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/08/15/slaves-want-to-be-slaves.html">&lt;p&gt;I studied in a very restrictive college called Panimalar Engineering in Chennai. It was so restrictive that it had rules like boys and girls should not speak with each other, the most stupid law there was we must reach college only using the college bus, I wondered why, they also said what dress we must wear (kind of like Iran), and there was a law saying girls should not wear high heel footwear, I really wonder who is going to look at heals of footwear?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I protested to my fellow friends about these stupid rules and asked them what they thought it served? Surprisingly they said these laws were good and aided our Engineering studies. With management being crack (but cunning enough to extract our parents’ wealth), most teachers being substandard (those good enough left the college soon), and most of my friends being illogical, I felt like being in a mental asylum, and I endured jail for 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think in real Jail we can go to library when we wish, but in my college it was not so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just imagine, you are a non mad man who is not praising Nithyanandha and you are in his Ashram where every one praises him. That kind of environment was my college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I was reading book about Sardar and saw this quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A parrot which is kept in a cage for years does not like to come out even if the cage is kept open. Slaves even if they find out a way to free themselves from the bondage they hesitate to go that way. Long-time slavery generates a fascination for a state of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– Sardar Vallabhai Patel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought of my friends working in slave companies, friends who use Mac (which includes me), iPhones, Windows, and Android phones (me inclusive). I thought of people who code in JavaScript and feel great about it. Parrots they are. I also thought of my friends who still supported my college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also thought of friend who said to me LinkedIn &lt;em&gt;‘You joined Panimalar knowing it’s stupid rules’&lt;/em&gt;, hell no, do I look like utter brain-dead?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I studied in a very restrictive college called Panimalar Engineering in Chennai.

&lt;p&gt;Though skilled, I was shocked to see a small boy driving a scooter, I scanned for policeman and none was there, the boy must have been a local who knew well and what he was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t stop thinking about this boy’s parents, how irresponsible they are to let a kid drive at such a young age. OMR mostly consists of learned people, I am not saying learned people are intelligent, that’s different, but learned people don’t make their child do irresponsible things. So to see a boy in OMR shocked me a bit. We can see such kind of behavior in villages where people do not know the law, and don’t care to be responsible parents. There they confuse emotion and responsibility and anything that gives them good emotional feeling is responsible thing for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t stop thinking what kind of adult this boy will grow up, may be fuck a girl in his 10th standard and become a father? Who knows? He would get bribes and his parents wouldn’t care about it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shouldn’t people who want to have kids know that they should be responsible to the society and should bring up productive and responsible kids needed for society? People are irresponsible and are breeding evil. I wonder what evil he is going to do, and how many are going to be affected by his irresponsible action when he grows up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another day I was in my car parked under a tree, early morning in Sithalapakkam, a boy with a juice carton in his left hand, sipping it with a straw controlling his scooter with his right hand drove past my car, stopped before it, drank all the juice, tossed the carton not into dustbin, but on to a bush nearby and drove on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People in my neighborhood are disturbing my tranquility by shouting praises for lord Muruga. Somehow people seem to think you need to show off your devotion for God to be in his good books. For some reason, the almighty God’s these days needs publicity, PR, lots of money, and people like priests to survive. Requiring so much support just for survival, we still consider her as the almighty, and claim ourselves Homo sapiens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thoughts ran, I was told by my mother that Kandahar, the present capital of Afghanistan is actually Gandhari Nagaram, that is, it was given as the gift to Gouravas as dowry when Gandhari was married to their family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to these praises of Murugan / Kandhan, I began to wonder could it be even older, could it have had the name Kandhan Nagaram, the city of Kandhan, today a God, but then a mighty warrior king who was undefeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His armies might have marched from the Himalayas to the Peninsula, he might have been instrumental to have laid the basis of formal Tamil language, maybe he and Pandiyas were great friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kandan was so victorious, that Afghans when they saw Alexanders war tactics and victories started calling him Sikandar. They still call him like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What ever it was, I am sad that India which should have stretched from Afghanistan to Burma (both inclusive). And from Kashmir to Srilanka is not complete yet. We need a great leader like Murugan again to unite our nation and get back the lost bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current Indian government is unable to pick up garbage, unable to vanquish dogs that bark and disturb my night sleep, it’s unable to eliminate cattle that litter streets and causes accidents, it’s unable to even reduce the prices of essential food items.

Aurangzeb, an Islamic ruler in India, did ban arts and music when he ruled. They are the true believers of Islam and almost follow the Quran to the dot. How many true Muslims are there in this world if you count that a person is a Muslim if he only follows Quran exactly, it would be near zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in India where none of the women in Muslim families I know wear Hijab, they go for job, they are progressive, they marry who ever they please and they don’t face resistance from family, they go to temples, and churches. This is not just in India, this happens in Tunisia, and in lots of African countries where Islam is the primary religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taliban and ISIS were formed to mend that. They want to conquer the whole world and make it pure Islamic, so that we can’t even fly kites for entertainment, we can’t even get medical treatment for our mother, spouse, sister and daughter because Allah want them to suffer and die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Image how long that kind of pure Islam would last? Won’t human nature of caring for people outshine the words of Allah and get women in our family a medical treatment if they are in pain? Aren’t we brave enough to face eternal hell for caring for our people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Islam is a joke. People who do believe in Islam do so without analyzing it thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s come to Hinduism, it’s not even a religion, people think it’s a religion because the Brits said so to Indians. Once even Sikhs were classifieds as Hindus, today Lingayat (who are Hindu’s by law) are fighting to have their own religion. So what is Hinduism? It seems to be a set of beliefs that people in the land of India have. There are so many beliefs in India and nothing is fixed. Indiran was worshiped like hell in my state Tamilnad, but now Shivan and Vishnu dominate, and yet these people claim they are the same. The value of morality greatly vary when our God takes avatar. The values for Ram is different from the values of Krishna, the values of Krishna are different from values of Nithyanandha. Each God comes, changes the society for that time and goes off. Yet these people say they follow the same religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change is the only constant in Hinduism, in Islam it’s not. What Quran says is ultimate, and it cannot be changed. This inability for God to change, the inability for their God to send another messenger will make Islam so incompatible and intolerable to modern society, and it should vanish. The current form of Hinduism too will vanish bit Hinduism will last in some form, because Hindus will claim themselves as Hindus no matter however they change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If in another 500 years, if Jesus is considered son of Hindu God and Mother Mary who is Amman’s avatar, and Joseph is a mere uncle of Jesus, it’s not surprising. Similarly, I feel Islamist in India will be so different from Arabs they will totally lose their identity. If you feel that’s a remote possibility think of lord Ganesh, is it and Hindu God?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Taliban’s banned beauty parlors, they burned musical instruments saying that music is evil and corrupts the youth. Aurangzeb, an Islamic ruler in India, did ban arts and music when he ruled. They are the true believers of Islam and almost follow the Quran to the dot. How many true Muslims are there in this world if you count that a person is a Muslim if he only follows Quran exactly, it would be near zero.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">htmx is far far better than ReactJS</title><link href="/2023/07/27/htmx-is-far-far-better-than-reactjs.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="htmx is far far better than ReactJS" /><published>2023-07-27T22:32:00+05:30</published><updated>2023-07-27T22:32:00+05:30</updated><id>/2023/07/27/htmx-is-far-far-better-than-reactjs</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/07/27/htmx-is-far-far-better-than-reactjs.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://nftstorage.link/ipfs/bafkreigd6jwvqv3afn3cfcf3gdycp7xij5fia3bjqdwvt263gl6nczibwm&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last job interview I was asked to solve problems in Ruby, it was nothing for me and I did it with ease, I was told I will be developing in Ruby on Rails, that was cool, that’s the framework of my choice, and still I would recommend it if you want to start and deliver your projects fast. The downside is if your project becomes large, then if you don’t have good enough programmers you will pay the price that’s a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company was a good company, fortunately my boss is not an evil one, a very rare thing to find these days, but my contribution was bad. The reason? ReactJS. I was told I would code in Ruby on Rails, but when I came in people over here called themselves full stack developers, used Ruby on Rails at the backend and React at the front end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Why, Why, Why? Why people don’t realize Ruby on Rails is a full-stack framework? Truly God only knows. Rails has given the most productive way to produce web apps yet, and people switch its front end to ultra low productive ReactJS, Angular or View. One of my hypothesis is, I am in India, here we bill clients based on head count, and the more complex you make the project, the more head counts, more bills and more profit. I can’t think of any other logical way. Or may be the project got started with speculation without bothering to look into facts about tech stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any way I was told I am a 19+ years experienced programmer and I have to be productive with this React. I should have quit, but I did not and tried to learn React, and till now, for more than a year I can say I have not learned it, I feel very uncomfortable using it. Ruby on Rails never embraced these clunky front end frameworks and evolved its own better one called HOT Wire which is 10X faster to develop than ReactJS. There is no work to convert something to JSON, and then there is no worry to convert JSON back to HTML in the front end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Rails purists, telling to use JavaScript is torture. The creation of JavaScript is an example how badly project could be managed and how an embarrassing software could be produced. May be if researchers are searching for proof of decline of human intelligence, JavaScript should be considered the top most proof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ReactJS takes this dirty imperfect, embarrassing JavaScript and makes it more dirty, imperfect and embarrassing. It’s a struggle for anyone who wants to write clean code to come to terms with the messiness of React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of the Clojure forums, I found htmx, and WOW! It was just like HOT Wire that is Rails default front end these days. ReactJS makes you write more and more JavaScript, htmx reduces it, it gives so much power that even a backed developer can become a front end developer, I saw htmx for a weekend and I can say I am a htmx developer. It reminded me of Ruby, I read a Ruby book, the one with two giraffes in it, I think that evening I was writing software for my mother to rank her students. That’s how productive Ruby was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I will become better in ReactJs and the so-called full stack (I call it hell-stack), and I will be considered better developer, or maybe I won’t, but what ever I do next, I am sure I should not lay hands upon these React, Angular, Vue, and what ever that ravages human minds. Unfortunately I cannot avoid React as my pay depends on it :(. I wish my clients project started today rather than when React was in its heyday. I work with really smart people, they catch the smell of good tech soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice to all those people choosing software to make people in your company code, there is a simple solution, you start the project with tools you pick, you do the initial developer, if you are leader, then lead, don’t just sit in a chair and talk. Once you think a thing is easy enough to use, then recommend it to the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen in my many friends companies, people just think something is better due to speculation, and they push their teams to that hell and hope that their teams stay professional. That’s not tech leadership.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
