&lt;p&gt;I have heard stories about Trump, how much idiot he is. My friends say some of their American clients gets furious when name of Trump gets mentioned. Many in USA view it as a disgrace and depletion of intelligence to America for him to have got elected. Well, here in India we have been electing very stupid leaders in my state Tamilnadu. We Tamil’s are so idiot that we don’t even realize that we have been electing idiots for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any way this blog is about Trump. I was thrown back when Trump linked Socialism to lack of freedom in State of Union speech. Socialism has got nothing to do with lack of freedom or has got nothing to do with freedom. Socialism is nothing more than social living. Its like you teaching your kid share its lunch with a friend in class who has forgotten its lunch. Its that simple. You can see Socialism with mother who has lot of kids. A kid that faces challenge gets more attention, for example a new born child receives more attention than a kid that’s able to go to school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socialism can be forced or unforced. You helping your neighbor, or community is a unforced socialism, but say a class teacher forcing your kid to share its lunch with the one who has failed to bring it is a forced one. In a similar way capitalism can be forced and unforced. A free market is a free capitalism, but are we consulted before making economic laws, or are few business people consulted before a law in made in a capitalistic land? Aren’t the will of the super rich are forced upon us? Think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An economic model chosen by a community has got nothing to do with the sense of freedom. Sense of freedom is a relative term and its very hard to define. Its hilarious that a person who is controlling the most powerful nation on this planet cannot grasp it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Aadhar Mystery</title><link href="/2019/02/03/the-aadhar-mystery.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Aadhar Mystery" /><published>2019-02-03T18:15:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-02-03T18:15:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/02/03/the-aadhar-mystery</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/02/03/the-aadhar-mystery.html">&lt;audio controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the recent 5 state election held recently the BJP lost, not by lot of votes, but it lost to the Congress. The Congress is building its image and is trying to project an image that its the nations savior from the Nazi Modi. Modi is a Nazi, no doubt about it, but Congress had it Nazi rulers too called Indra Gandhi and her son Rajiv Gandhi who tried to wipe out my Tamil race in Srilanka. Is Rahul Gandhi any different? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rahul-is-a-liar&quot;&gt;Rahul is a liar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rahul is certainly a liar. He lied to the nation about Rafel deal and called it a scam. The congress and team went to the supreme court and lost, yet they don’t want to admit their lies. Pathetic. Can we let such liars to rule the nation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;promotion-for-kamalnath&quot;&gt;Promotion for Kamalnath&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kamalnath is a C.M now, but when Indra Gandhi died its said that he killed lot of Sikhs. He escaped the law that’s a different thing. If a party is run by good blooded people, will a possible killer even be considered for a C.M post? On one hand Congress says Modi is evil because he killed Muslims in Gujrat, but Kamalnath is good because he killed Sikhs during Indra’s death. Where is the logic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dynastic-politics&quot;&gt;Dynastic Politics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its sicking to know that a 100 year old party cannot find its leaders outside a single family. And they say Congress is democratic. What a lie! These people have allied with DMK and S.P which are parties that follow dynastic politics too. if congress succeeds, we will soon see a nation ruled by few families. Is that what we want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-much-difference&quot;&gt;Not much difference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from not having Hindu fanaticism right now, congress is no better. Why vote for it?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Will Engineering Colleges Survive?</title><link href="/2018/12/05/will-engineering-colleges-survive.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Will Engineering Colleges Survive?" /><published>2018-12-05T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-12-05T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2018/12/05/will-engineering-colleges-survive</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2018/12/05/will-engineering-colleges-survive.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuow/files/styles/x_large/public/201506/20150603-boeing-engineer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder weather Engineering colleges in Tamilnadu will survive for long, they are already falling and many have them have closed down or turned into arts and science colleges. The reason, well there are some which I wish to post here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-culture-of-looting&quot;&gt;The culture of looting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engineering colleges, almost all of them were created not to impart education to the masses, but in a hope of looting people and escaping from taxes by creating a trust. Many families in India do not know what Engineering is and they blindly put their kid into one. In fact many of the so called engineers in India do not know what engineering is. Take any person who has studied engineering and put him in a company, he will falter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Engineering college does is to sells you is a myth. A piece of paper that is worthless, but you buy it for Rs 4 Lakhs or so. With that myth which says you are a certified engineer, you come to the real world and find out that you are not one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact companies like mine employ these non engineers, give them money for free and give them real engineering tasks which the colleges have failed to do. And we find that the so called engineers are clueless and no idea how to complete them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prevention-of-foreign-universities-landing-on-india&quot;&gt;Prevention of foreign universities landing on India&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India has been intelligent to allow foreign investment in I.T, but we don’t see foreign universities teaching kids and making them better professionals. Kapil Sibal wanted to bring in foreign universities and offer competition to Indian ones, but these corrupted lot here bribed various channels and stopped it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without competition, our universities have stagnated and are teaching outdated stuff, their collaboration with Industry is almost nil, and even if we in Industry go on to help them, those so called engineers are so so substandard that they become liability to a company than an asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have missed an excellent opportunity of skill development because colleges and universities here have excellent bribing power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;comeback-of-foreign-universities&quot;&gt;Comeback of foreign universities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was interviewing for my friends company, I wasn’t interested in what college they studied or what marks they got, but I was interested what work they had done before applying. Students of Indian colleges have done nothing but to WhatsApp their friends, but students who have got degrees from edx, Coursera, Udacity etc seems to have done work and you know it from their talk. So a situation is now arising where though denied opportunity, foreign universities are coming to us via the internet and are increasing our educational quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a tech companies, we want people who can solve problems and work for us, rather than some one who says that “I own a piece of paper that says I am an Engineer”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-you-need-to-be-a-engineer&quot;&gt;Do you need to be a Engineer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe me, the work I do, if properly trained an 8th standard guy could do it. In today’s world you need not be a branded as rocket scientist to become a real one, there is so much on the internet that you can find out how to do stuff and train yourself quiet easily. Its a myth that you must be an engineer. Remember the first person who might have started an engineering college wouldn’t have been an engineering degree holder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We @ IT companies are not really looking at people who do have engineering degree, but we are looking at people who can do our tech tasks. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-cost&quot;&gt;The Cost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the cost. Should you need to pay Rs 4 Lakhs and invest 4 years to become an engineer if you can get a better degree with better training by investing just Rs 5000/- on an online degree and spending just 3 to 6 months? I hope you have common sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now small companies are failing to recognize engineers, soon even huge gorillas too will feel the pressure and do the same.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What Actor Vijay &amp;amp; Kamal won’t tell about freebies</title><link href="/2018/12/01/what-actor-vijay-kamal-won-t-tell-about-freebies.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What Actor Vijay &amp; Kamal won't tell about freebies" /><published>2018-12-01T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-12-01T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2018/12/01/what-actor-vijay-kamal-won-t-tell-about-freebies</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2018/12/01/what-actor-vijay-kamal-won-t-tell-about-freebies.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/10/vijay-7591.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great promo for this film Sarkar, the film team was able to dip into the anger of AIADMK people thus earning much needed publicity. AIADMK got angry because it teased freebie scheme that was brought in by Kamaraj, Strangthened by Karuna, MGR and continued by Jaya. Kamal even went as far as saying that people who get stuff for free are beggars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Vijay fans too heard the message and supported Vijay by burning free stuff the government gave them, but here is the catch, they posted it on social networks that was a free service! Neither Vijay, Murugadoss or Kamal opposed it by saying people are taking freebies from tech giants and becoming slaves to them. That’s amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to free stuff given to Actors. The land for MGR film city was given by the people of Tamilnadu to these actors for free. Will Vijay, Murugadoss or Kamal are willing to make propaganda among film fraternity to return the land to the people? We promote a film and promote it in social network for free for them, in return these people won’t even give a rupee for a post. Are they ready to pay us for that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is this &lt;em&gt;Nadigar Sangam&lt;/em&gt; that does help to actors who are not in good economic situation, will Kamal call them beggars? Why not? Are actors deserved to get freebies by law and only Tamil people are deserved to be called as beggars?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must evaluate who are beggars and who are not. Kamal gets sunlight for free, he does not pay for rain water, he breathes this oxygen free, he paid nothing to come into existence. The earth supports plants for free, plants and animals produce food for us free, the Earth does not charge rent for our stay. In fact man created money so that one can claim to be superior to other, else everything we have is free, we have just created an illusion that everything costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are reading this blog because I transmit my knowledge for free, some one hosts my blog for free, and some on e wrote the software tools to build this blog for free. Else information on your screen could cause dear and you will be reading say one highly expensive article a week and brag about the information wealth you obtained to the people known to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So realize that just because some one says something novel or new or out of ordinary, it does not mean that they care about you, all they want is to grab your attention and sell their movie to you and make you their propaganda tool.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Install latest version of imagemagick in Ubuntu 18.04</title><link href="/2018/11/22/install-latest-version-of-imagemagick-in-ubuntu-18-04.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Install latest version of imagemagick in Ubuntu 18.04" /><published>2018-11-22T15:58:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-11-22T15:58:00+05:30</updated><id>/2018/11/22/install-latest-version-of-imagemagick-in-ubuntu-18-04</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2018/11/22/install-latest-version-of-imagemagick-in-ubuntu-18-04.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/ImageMagick_logo.svg/1200px-ImageMagick_logo.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lot of resources available on internet to install imagemagick. But everytime I struggle when I install it. Sometimes it misses dependency or sometime misses required delegation like png, jpeg etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I thought to write short note about it to install imagemagick in one try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will install it from source so that we can know the exact version. Now, follow below steps to install Imagemagick 7.0.8-2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt-get update&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install required dependency&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt-get &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;build-essential checkinstall libx11-dev libxext-dev zlib1g-dev libpng12-dev libjpeg-dev libfreetype6-dev libxml2-dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, go to /opt directory and download latest version of imagemagick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /opt

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;wget http://www.imagemagick.org/download/ImageMagick.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will download latest version of imagemagick. While writing this it was 7.0.8-2 Unzip it and follow remaining steps for installation and configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo tar &lt;/span&gt;xvzf ImageMagick.tar.gz
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;ImageMagick-7.0.8-2
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo touch &lt;/span&gt;configure
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; ./configure
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;make
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;make &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install
sudo &lt;/span&gt;ldconfig /usr/local/lib
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;make check&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check if installation is successful using below command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;convert &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it installed correctly then you can see output like below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;Version: ImageMagick 7.0.8-2 Q16 x86_64 2018-06-24 https://www.imagemagick.org

It brought shame to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really understand women, possibly its okay for them to get money for sex, but that guy was a man. As a man I feel that men should not become prostitutes. Its a shame. We fought the British not to get their wealth, but to stop them from seducing us with their power and wealth. We are men!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In India, male prostitution amounts more than female ones. Female prostitutes usually don’t marry and do it with many males, prostitute males usually get a lump sum amount from the females family and try to be dedicated for them by marrying them. In soul both these female and male prostitutes are the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am  a prostitute too :( , yup I usually had a vision of a simple marriage, a calm life. I thought I would marry a girl, i.e we will have a very good understanding, but circumstances made me a prostitute. I should have walked away if I were a pure soul, but I stayed put for my convenience and for the sake of not hurting others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought my engagement would be simple. My family said that it will be in a temple with two families exchanging confirmations of marriage, but it turned out to be different. First there was a expensive suit purchased for me by my wife with my money :(. Okay I thought, she might be intoxicated with the feeling of getting married. There were shoes purchased (with my money). I am in Tamilnadu, a hot country where I see only idiots wear shoes and it sweats. But people do it because copying European culture seems to make them feel secure and superior. Europe is a different region dumbos! Its far far away from the equator, look at the map. Tamilnadu is near the equator. I often wondered why people don’t think, but they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though all was bought, I had a feeling that engagement would be simple. On the day engagement, I was asked to come to a hotel, as soon as I got out of the lift there were photographers shooting me and directing me how I must pose. I was a puppet and not myself. Of-course prostitutes are puppets :( . It was very clear that the lavish expense was just for show off. There were nearly 100 guests, they all ate food while I stood near my wife on the podium could only watch in hunger as they ate and enjoyed. I felt like I was in prison. When I finally came to eat in all hunger, there was almost no food. I left the place hungry and got myself a tandoori in my hotel room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My marriage was even more lavish. it was all about money and show off than about two hearts understanding each other. My in-laws never really knew even my name. My name on the podium was wrong and none seemed to care about it. The irony was I was marrying a to be doctor in English literature, and they did not know to write my name well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a few days after my marriage, just like a horse is stamped they stamped me as prostitute. My inlaws presented me a gold chain, bracelet, I had a engagement ring too. I am supposed to wear these at every function to show off my status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We remember Thiruvalluvar not for the gold he wore, we remember Auvaiyaar for the dress she wore, but we remember them. If we ask who was the richest person in the Pandiyas period, none knows. That’s our Tamil culture. We have never valued wealth, we have valued what one stood form what ones ideas were.&lt;/p&gt;

I wish I had a pure soul.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I was at Star Briyani in Chennai One road, the table next to me was a guy bragging about how much gold he is getting from his in-laws for his marriage. It brought shame to me.</summary></entry></feed>
