&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember when, it was a day when I bought Salem R.R Chicken Briyani and ate it, it was so good that even without my realization I ate it without any side dish. My respect for Salem R.R went through the roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next week I bought Briyani at the very same Salem R.R and I tried to eat, this time I was unable to swallow it without side dish. Compared to previous one this was crap. I am a regular buyer, and all subsequent weeks it was somewhere between crap and the good tasty one. Yesterday it came close to the good tasty one but was still far behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salem R.R is costly costs 200/- even for chicken. Though the quantity is little bit higher, it costs a bit high. For that cost they must give some justification in taste. One week its good and another its crap. I hope they hire process experts, apply some scientific management and make the taste consistent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Better Dask Than Spark</title><link href="/2019/06/25/better-dask-than-spark.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Better Dask Than Spark" /><published>2019-06-25T16:12:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-06-25T16:12:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/06/25/better-dask-than-spark</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/06/25/better-dask-than-spark.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dask.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to meddle with Data. I wanted to be a A.I guy when I was in college, but we were not allowed to take that elective, and A.I then was very different than its now. Back in 2004, 1 GB was considered a luxury, only very few carried laptops, desktops were computers then, and no iPhones then. People were having less devices that spied on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now things have changed thanks to the bullish push of Silicon foundries around the world. Price per compute has fallen like hell. Any one having right skill and slim wallet can have banks of computers working for him in minutes, we have Raspberry Pi thats so small and far powerful and far cheaper than the first computer I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;316&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CXCjpJasvG0?color=white&amp;amp;theme=light&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people who love computers, its like kid in candy store where the price of candy drops by the day. Wish I saw the same smartness and price drop in energy, health, education and food industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With computers becoming so cheap, and so much data available, what an A.I project would take months or a year, will possibly take a week or two to complete. Such has grown computer hardware and software that has run on it. Thanks to Free Software Foundation, most great softwares that are available today are affordable and do not have shackling licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for people like me, doing a A.I curiosity project is a monthly exercise than a dream. I use Python, Numpy and Scikit-learn for most of my stuff. Most of the A.I things are just looking at data, cleaning it and trying to fit it in a model and checking the accuracy of prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s get to the practical situation, we know that A.I algorithm spits out a better predicting model if it has more data to train it. So you have a toy data set in your office and you are confident the code you coded has a spit out a model that is good enough. Now your boss tells to scale, and there your smile disappears. You may be good at looking at data and making computers predict something out of it, but when it comes to scaling, nah, thats not your game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need Spark, right? I don’t think so. There is a new stuff called Dask &lt;a href=&quot;https://dask.org/&quot;&gt;https://dask.org/&lt;/a&gt; , I haven’t tried it yet, but reading this &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/spark.html&quot;&gt;https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/spark.html&lt;/a&gt; tells me its time to say goodbye to spark.
Rather than having a separate scaling up guy for your A.I project, Dask might let a Datascientist do it, and it seems to fit the normal data science workflow without adding much to the learning curve. So try it out if your project is getting bigger.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">One good thing I have done for my friends</title><link href="/2019/06/21/one-good-thing-i-have-done-for-my-friends.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="One good thing I have done for my friends" /><published>2019-06-21T13:25:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-06-21T13:25:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/06/21/one-good-thing-i-have-done-for-my-friends</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/06/21/one-good-thing-i-have-done-for-my-friends.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/chennai.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one good thing I have done for my friends in the past 2 years or more, that is to prevent many from buying a house in Chennai, and i am so proud to have saved them lot of money. Here is why you must not buy a house in Chennai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chennai is a dying city, having no water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, Chennai is a dying city. Not many people love Chennai, not many people in Chennai identify them as Chennaiites, they love their villages and towns and do not bother to maintain this city. This neglect has made lot of harm to Chennai, stray dogs, overflowing garbage, lack of good clean infra, and Chennai is always controlled by corrupt politicians and cops. This neglect and using Chennai as a money source has depleted it, now we don’t even have water here. To get back things to normal is going to take years and possibly decades. Till that time comes if you buy a home you will be spending any where between 5% - 25% of your earnings for just buying water. Is it good?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chennai has lot of water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact Chennai has lot of water. More rain rains here than that is needed by the people over here to use, but only 5% of it goes into the ground, which means 2 - 3 % only is put to real good use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of water capture can be seen every where in Chennai, even for moderate rains the roads will be flooded and traffic will be jammed. The government is waste and is comprised only of looters, but what about the people? Can’t they do something about it? No, never. Imagine how much of a fool the people need to be to elect such a foolish looters as our rulers. I never think Chennai people will have sufficient intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only if Chennai turns to dust, and some intelligent beings start to settle here that can really think, will this place prosper again. I feel its only a matter of time that Chennai becomes a dead city.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">AN-32 Crash, Where is my tax money?</title><link href="/2019/06/06/an-32-crash-where-is-my-tax-money.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AN-32 Crash, Where is my tax money?" /><published>2019-06-06T21:49:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-06-06T21:49:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/06/06/an-32-crash-where-is-my-tax-money</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/06/06/an-32-crash-where-is-my-tax-money.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.pinimg.com/736x/93/85/73/938573ade83be39210e1c8585599333d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, another military plane crash in India. Our planes are not maintained, some how Narendra Modi’s, Amit Shaha’s, Rahul Gandhi’s planes are in tiptop condition and never crash. Imagine how good our nation would be if law of nature crashes politicians vehicle when ever he or she tells a lie. There wouldn’t be enough vehicles left in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AN-32 crash sends a message to Pakistan too. They must realise that Indian government kills more Indian solders than its terrorist does. So it must shift its strategy to become more effective. Perhaps it can do us more harm if it funds our political parties than funding Madrasas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have always heard this, that our army is capable of dealing with any kind of invasion. Well, good, that means we must in a great, well oiled condition, but are we? Wonder where all those money that we pay for the military goes? Some how we don’t even know the Rafel prices, even though its our money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever noticed? When ever there is a bad news Modi is not at all in the picture and media never questions where he is.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Saw The Accidental Priminister</title><link href="/2019/05/26/saw-the-accidental-priminister.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Saw The Accidental Priminister" /><published>2019-05-26T17:45:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-05-26T17:45:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/05/26/saw-the-accidental-priminister</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/05/26/saw-the-accidental-priminister.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmJmYjU4ZmMtNTFjZC00MWYzLWFjNDktMzRmNGZhZDU0ZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjE1OTQ0NjA@._V1_QL50_SY1000_CR0,0,691,1000_AL_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I saw the movie “The Accidental Priminister”, well thats how I spell it :). It was good, wonder why congress supporters don’t like it? Don’t they think that it would be good for Congress and nation if the party does not cater to a single family and caters to people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this movie they say Manmohan Singh is just a jaalra to Sonia Gandhi. I believe it’s true. Indira Gandhi was a jaalara to the Soviets, Narasima Rao was a jaalar to the USA. Vajpyee was a jaalara to communal forces and the RSS and so does Modi follows in his footsteps (Vajpyeee did not have the opportunity to commit a genocide though). All our leaders were jaalara to something. So I don’t think its really says bad about Manmohan Singh. He was doing what many so called leaders of our nation did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One good thing is Sanjaya Banu wrote a book about Manmohan, imagine if some had wrote a book exposing Modi, (s)he would have been named Anti Indian, either he and his family should have fled India or would have disappeared or would have been killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So showing Manmohan as jaalara, a truth coming out about a gentleman was not a surprise for me. What I noticed was the movies accuracy of star casting and how they portrayed the PMO and Sonia’s house in detail. Here I am in Sithalapakkam, worrying about my water supply, worrying whether it would be cost effective to turn on my A/C to quench the sweltering heat, worrying about whether to give my car for repair or not, having no clue how will I be 25 years from now, or will I exist 25 years from now? Or before I die will I live in a house that stands besides a tar road. I don’t have water, clean air, future is doubtful, yet the opulence with which these servants of mine who eat my tax money live with stunned me. The parties they attend are top class and they don’t pay for it. Its free for them :(.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure none in power ever sweats or feels cold, they are been cooled and heated by our sweat and blood. The infrastructure they enjoy is like a five seven service every day. I think their medicine too is free. That would explain why many old guys stick to power. While we citizens wait for busses under direct sun, they travel in convoys in nice and cozy environment. Thats what I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder what makes a Indian accept that a Priminister or President who is our mere servant can have a unrealistic better life than us which we cannot even imagine? Or is it that I am the one who just thinks and all are dumb?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">India under Nazi Rule</title><link href="/2019/05/23/india-under-nazi-rule.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="India under Nazi Rule" /><published>2019-05-23T18:20:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-05-23T18:20:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/05/23/india-under-nazi-rule</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/05/23/india-under-nazi-rule.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/anj/hitler-modi/359878701.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the BJP has won. I wonder weather there will be another central government election in India. Or whether we will spiral into wars defeating our neighbours and so a leader who will be our warlord will rule our country forever? Let’s see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For beef lovers, the days are done. I think its time for them to quit India and go to a liberal nation. There is no guarantee that there would be no lynching and killing of people who love to eat beef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any one who questions the government will be called an Anti-Indian, would be put into trouble by government officials and would be jailed, poisoned there and if they are still not yielding they would disappear. For example loot at the fate of Piyush Manush, he is been tortured now and then, Thirumurugan Gandhi is poisoned, and Mugilan has disappeared, most probably he has been killed in a brutal way, who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was looking at the behaviour of Modi, his behaviour and that of Adolf Hitler are very similar. Let me tell you waht I found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both Hitler and Modi started from humble beginnings. Hitler was a simple solder, a painter dreaming big for his nation and Modi was working in a tea shop.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both Modi and Hitler love their nation. Thats unquestionable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both have a strong feeling that what they think and do is the right thing for the nation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both don’t listen to intellectuals around them, take for instance the demonetisation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both are narcissist and, love do grand things so that people praise them. They want for their names to be eternal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both have high self discipline and are relatively uncorrupt.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hitler had Himler with him and Modi has Amit Shah.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both Nazi party and BJP has a violent and ultra nationalist wing attached with it, for Nazi’s its the SS, for BJP its the RSS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both have a reason to hit at neighbours. For the Nazi’s its the greatness of Germany. Here I strongly suspect how there could be a bomb blast in Pulwama if we have strong Chowkidars who guard the nation. Or they are Chowkidars for name sake and are real dummies?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modi is loved by international committee and so was Hitler, until the day realised his true intentions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both Hitler and Modi have got the reputation of manipulating governments data. Modi is a economic debacle, so he has told statisticians to manipulate data so that the economy looks good. Hitler manipulated government economic data too. Almost none in public knew the money spent for killing jews. But under Hitler, economy improved, under Modi it slides down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The press in Nazi Germany was highly controlled by the Nazi party, and so is the same case in India. Watch the news channels, there would always be a pro Modi news that has no substance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Freedom of expression was highly controlled.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Take for instance women trying to enter Aiyappan, God is equal to all, but they are still been denied the right despite the court ruling in favour of them.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Take for instance the killing of Gauri Lankesh and how the case is still unsolved.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In Tamilnadu take for instance ruining of the life of Perumal Murugan by Hindu’s.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lets see what the future holds. I feel Modi’s brain and attitude is on a knife edge he could be just a normal PM and he could be a psycho like Hitler. Unlike Vajpyee and like Hitler he has no patience and self control and could let loose. In fact Modi has done it, in Nazi Germany Jews were persecuted and in Modi Gujarat Muslims were slain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this land, miracles have happened, Chand Ahoka became Ashoka The Great, Alexanders Violent push to rule the Earth came to an end, we defeated the greatest empire at that time (ruled by Winston Chruchill, a blood thirsty Englishman who starved us to death) without firing a shot. Lets see whether this land would go into dark ruins because of this mad man called Modi and his Hindu clan, or lets see whether our soil turns him into nice one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Sithalapakkam dries up</title><link href="/2019/05/19/sithalapakkam-dries-up.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sithalapakkam dries up" /><published>2019-05-19T21:09:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-05-19T21:09:00+05:30</updated><id>/2019/05/19/sithalapakkam-dries-up</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/05/19/sithalapakkam-dries-up.html">&lt;p&gt;We were forced to drill a bore in our home in Sithalapakkam today.

&lt;p&gt;The Christchurch Call simply does not stand in accordance with freedom of expression. It says violent and terrorist videos that are online must be eliminated, but why? Why it’s wrong to portray violence online? I don’t understand. Are we humans going to act as though we are not a violent species? That sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right from the time of chimps we have been violent. There are documented evidences showing that chimps do conduct genocide and mass murder, we just continue it. It’s just part of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next comes the issue of what’s terrorism. Bhagatsingh is a hero in India and terrorist in the U.K. Osama Binladen is a hero to many Muslims around the world, to others he’s a terrorist. Nathuram Gotse is a nationalist to hardline Hindus in India, but a terrorist to rationalist. When whats terror and not terror, and whats violent and whats act of war and self defence varies from perspective to perspective. In that case we can’t say a stuff is violent or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for example a man slaying his goat for his family. His kids would love to eat it. According to them, their father is kind and non violent person, but according to the goat he is a killer and a terrorist. It all depends on the perspective and we must respect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terrorism, violence, good and bad, etc are all human defined terms and they vary from place to place. It’s stupid to say that what few countries that have signed the Christchurch Call, call as violent and hateful acts are violent and hateful. You in the western world would not call USA’s and UK’s war as a violent act do you? But imagine how many lives it has affected. How many people have felt helpless because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The priminister if Newzeland I suppose has got no other job after her loosing her post, so she is trying to portray herself as a global leader who is soooo good so that she can win again and again. Any way time has presented a very good chance for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India too happily signed it because here now cow eaters are being killed, so if any one shares the video of killing on social media, India can show this call and take down the video, thus putting up a scene as though India is a pure nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt very bad last week or the beginning of this week, Hamas lauched rockets into Gaza and Israel within no time retaliated and cease fire was reached between two sides. Israel is a tiny tiny nation with a tiny population, yet the are able to defeat the entire Arab world, strike their enemies when ever they are hit. Here we are second massive nation, 6th largest economy, if Pakistan terrorist strikes, we need to wait, plan and execute action fearing their army. Even if we kill less than a 100 of them we celebrate as a surgical strike. Are we really a nation that can defend itself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Masood Azad gets listed as terrorist and we celebrate, what the heck if he gets listed as terrorist or not? We haven’t killed him yet, even at this very instant he keeps plotting against India and rest of the world on how to bomb and kill some one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a impractical nation, we stay terror should be abolished and it hasn’t been abolished yet. From the 60’s we were saying we will abolish poverty, from the age of Periyaar we say we will do away with the caste system, we say politics and religion should be kept apart, we say bribes are illegal. Yet not one of the things we say and dream have materialized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon points to one thing: Indians are cowards, they say and they cannot do. Indian men should roam around wearing sarees and women should roam around wearing nothing.

He constantly advertised for hired hands. Most people were reluctant to work on farms along the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They dreaded the awful storms that raged across the Atlantic, wreaking havoc on the buildings and crops. As the farmer interviewed applicants for the job, he received a steady stream of refusals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a short, thin man, well past middle age, approached the farmer. ‘Are you a good farm hand?’ the farmer asked him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Well, I can sleep when the wind blows,’ answered the little man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although puzzled by this answer, the farmer, desperate for help, hired him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The little man worked well around the farm, busy from dawn to dusk, and the farmer felt satisfied with the man’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one night the wind howled loudly in from offshore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jumping out of bed, the farmer grabbed a lantern and rushed next door to the hired hand’s sleeping quarters. He shook the little man and yelled, ‘Get up! A storm is coming!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tie things down before they blow away!’ The little man rolled over in bed and said firmly, ‘No sir. I told you, I can sleep when the wind blows.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enraged by the response, the farmer was tempted to fire him on the spot. Instead, he hurried outside to prepare for the storm. To his amazement, he discovered that all of the haystacks had been covered with tarpaulins. The cows were in the barn, the chickens were in the coops, and the doors were barred. The shutters were tightly secured. Everything was tied down. Nothing could blow away. The farmer then understood what his hired hand meant, so he returned to his bed to also sleep while the wind blew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re prepared, spiritually, mentally, and physically, you have nothing to fear. Can you sleep when the wind blows through your life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hired hand in the story was able to sleep because he had secured the farm against the storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above story goes on to talk about trials and tribulations in life and if we do our best to understand, accept, and implement the principles learnt by us we will experience a deep sense of security, peace, and joy from within.  We will then be able to ‘sleep when the wind blows.’&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The following story circulated on the Internet - a superb metaphorical exposition of the level of preparedness.</summary></entry></feed>
