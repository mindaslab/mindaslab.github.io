&lt;p&gt;I am a programmer, like every programmer I want to finish a job quick for my client and get my pay with a smile. I was able to do it when I coded with PHP, I was able to do it when I coded in Ruby on Rails. In fact Ruby on Rails had a thing called RJS (Ruby Java Script). I don’t know who made it, but it was genius. In Rails it combined with Prototype and Scriptaculous and made writing front end a charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they moved to Coffeescript and jQuery, in my mind not a wise move, but it kind of worked, we were writing JavaScript-ish that sucked compared to RJS, but Coffeescript made it bit easy. I was presented with this learning curve to learn this jQuery. All this parent, child relationship made it suck, but I learned. I was still able to create apps faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today while developing a Rails app I don’t understand what’s going on. There is thing called webpack, yarn and I have to search for blogs to make jQuery and Twittter Bootstrap work with it. That’s pain, but once done productivity improves unless some idiot propose a brand new JavaScript library to be included so the project becomes cool. I personally thought going JavaScript way sucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I for long wished Opal became a part of Ruby on Rails. I wished code was easy to write as in the days of RJS. Today if you are writing software with Rails 5 or 6, you need to know about node, yarn, webpack and blah blah to be comfortable with it. It’s like a mini framework in this framework called Ruby on Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript has a philosophy that’s different than Ruby I suppose.  Ruby was clearly written to make programmers life easy, when I switched from PHP to Ruby I could see it. PHP ecosystem meant deployment happiness, which Rails robbed away from us, thus paving way for companies like Heroku to overcharge us, but when it comes to total cost of developing webpages, Rails was okay. Butt this JavaScript, my God! It would make atheist like me to think that there was a previous birth and I had done very bad things to inherit this super bad Karma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus reading that Ruby might run in the browser was a kind of faint light in a dark hell. A distant and very faint light, but better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to think, even though Microsoft is an ultra evil company, they developed Blazor &lt;a href=&quot;https://blazor.net&quot;&gt;https://blazor.net&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9BhbGbTsyeE?color=white&amp;amp;theme=light&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/iframe&gt;
     &lt;/figure&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have this vision of making developers build full webapps with just C# and thus avoid JavaScript. Isn’t that good? For a while I even thought of ditching Ruby on Rails and switching to Blazor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All hopes not lost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Rails developer I would say that all hopes are not lost, it’s possible to develop apps without writing much of JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
        &lt;source src=&quot;https://d1snj8sshb5u7m.cloudfront.net/Rails7.mp4 &quot; /&gt;
      Your browser does not support the video element.
      &lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see that Rails is getting matured. May be one day doing Rails project might be as good as doing a pure Ruby project. I have to go through this tutorial when I have free time &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hotrails.dev/turbo-rails&quot;&gt;https://www.hotrails.dev/turbo-rails&lt;/a&gt;. May be I can get off writing a web app with almost no JavaScript very soon. Let’s see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really pissed off creating web pages today. In India people jump into things without trying things out. People, even in small projects introduce Angular, React into front end without knowing who created it and why it was created. Today you are considered a full stack developer only if you know these JavaScript framework. May be one day a full stack developer would also include VHDL and chip design as their profile, after all webpages are served by Integrated Circuits which too are part of stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May be I will learn Julia (Python sucks for DataScience) or something, finish writing my DataScience book &lt;a href=&quot;https://cliz.in/dsbuk&quot;&gt;https://cliz.in/dsbuk&lt;/a&gt; and escape the world where we take stuff out and put into RDMS via web apps. I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May be I will learn Clojure, avoid JavaScript all together by using it in backend and using ClojureScript in front end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s nice to be in a world dominated by free software. We have lot of choices. It’s up to programming languages and frameworks now. Will they  help us create better web apps without relying upon JavaScript, or else they will make people mad and drive them away? Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Some time back, don’t know when I saw this post https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2022/04/03/ruby-3-2-0-preview1-released/ and I couldn’t sleep that night.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">R.N.Ravi crushes Tamils in Tamilnadu</title><link href="/2022/04/14/r-n-ravi-crushes-tamils-in-tamilnadu.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="R.N.Ravi crushes Tamils in Tamilnadu" /><published>2022-04-14T22:43:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-04-14T22:43:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/04/14/r-n-ravi-crushes-tamils-in-tamilnadu</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/04/14/r-n-ravi-crushes-tamils-in-tamilnadu.html">&lt;table&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our politics is dominated by scoundrels, and R.N.Ravi is no different. Rather than respecting the constitution and being a governor who does his duties well, he is just obeying the BJP and delaying to sign laws passed by Tamilnadu government. The question is “why?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the second world war there was a massive famine in India. Winston Churchill had transported all Indian grains to England to feed their army and people. Millions of Indians died and Winston Churchill was awarded the Nobel Prize. So why the world turned a blind eye to massive deaths in India?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today everyone empathizes with Ukrainians, thats great, but the world forgot about Tamil genocide in Srilanka, the world barely remembers genocide of Kurds by Turkey and genocide conducted by Bokoharam. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple answer is they are not us. People empathize and want to uplift only people who they can associate with. It’s a natural phenomenon. That’s how human brans work. Those who cannot empathize with us should not be allowed to rule us. It’s that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We Tamils should never let BJP conquer us. For more than 5000 years, the Hindus have made us worship Gods in their language Sanskrit. Said that Tamil is the language of people born to prostitutes and so on. Now we see one who holds such kind of values is our governor, and a party that holds such kind of value, the BJP, is ruling India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BJP people are so blind that it’s said that it’s minister Nirmala Sitharaman when questioned about rising onion prices seems to have said that she is not bothered about it because she does not consume onions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BJP wants us to blindly believe that they are the ones who should rule all over India. They want us to believe that they are divine, unquestionable, unappeasable, because they have got this divine power by drinking cow urine and eating cow shit every day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those states that are ruled by parties that don’t eat shit and drink urine,
BJP is irritating the government by telling the governor to be a impediment to the government appointed by the people. This is pure murder of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We Tamils should take a note of it, we must talk, blog, vlog about it, so that the world knows about Modi and his BJP. Many think he is great, but none knows how he is destroying us Tamils in Tamilnadu. Modi is not one of us, and BJP people smelling his farts and eating his shit is not one of us too. They are just Sanskrit speaking Winston Churchills. The world must know that Modi ruled India is not constitution respecting democracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">R.N.Ravi</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Finding outer products of vectors - Python Vs Julia</title><link href="/2022/04/03/finding-outer-product-of-vectors-python-vs-julia.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Finding outer products of vectors - Python Vs Julia" /><published>2022-04-03T20:46:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-04-03T20:46:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/04/03/finding-outer-product-of-vectors-python-vs-julia</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/04/03/finding-outer-product-of-vectors-python-vs-julia.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And hello Ruby community!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to announce the release of I Love Ruby’s new front cover, and here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeicjk7vvjv7xivcz2m2cmfmxr5ioeuriedw2vm6wjyoawtiq6ls2dm.ipfs.dweb.link/i%20love%20ruby%20front%20cover%20final.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It features playing kids discovering Ruby and running towards it. I hope you like it. I wish I have all the time writing and refining my books, but life has other plans for me. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z34jYvHK27o&amp;amp;list=PLe1T0uBrDrfNyJ8u6V_3fdwtFdSWPpU7M&quot;&gt;My Ruby books video series&lt;/a&gt; has stalled too. It’s sad to say it, as my book is really innovative, I think I came up with the idea of naming things starting with &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; even before Apple did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I am working for a company who’s app is coded in Rails, but some of its front end is in React 🤮 (Matz is nice so I am not nice to even out this world). As I am tanking up my JavaScript knowledge and spending all my time learning it, I start to hate it more, at the same time my love for Ruby becomes brighter. Why can’t every one think like Matz and DHH? Matz (and other Japanese Ruby contributors), if you are reading this blog, watch lot of Rajinikanth movies and do something to kill JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you people like the cover, and please encourage me so that I have the will to proceed. Please do discourage and spot mistakes so that I can improve my book. I expect this from Ruby beginners. In short give me lot of feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One may contact me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:mindaslab@protonmail.com&quot;&gt;mindaslab@protonmail.com&lt;/a&gt; or signal me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.me/#p/+918428050777&quot;&gt;+91 8428050777&lt;/a&gt;. And yes you can get my Ruby book here &lt;a href=&quot;https://i-love-ruby.gitlab.io/&quot;&gt;https://i-love-ruby.gitlab.io/&lt;/a&gt;. I will update it soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my life I have seen dynastic politics in my nation rather than one based on ones capability or professionalism. I think in 1983 Indra was assassinated only for the nation to see Rajiv rise to power, he was killed and now we have Sonia and Rahul. That’s the pathetic state of India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to Tamilnadu where I live, we have a party called DMK and its been dominated by one family which was spawned by Karunanidhi. After his death we were all sure that the next DMK leader won’t be elected in democratic way based on his merits, but him Stalin was sworn in unopposed. This was despite the eldest son of Karuna named Alagiri calling for an election to determine the leader in DMK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call ourself a nation of democracy, we want our nation to progress fast, we want our children and grand children to have a better life, for that people who lead us should rise due to their merit, and not because they are the child of someone. Now in Tamilnadu we know that after Stalin, Udhayanidhi, that is Stalin’s son and grandson of Karuna will be come the chief minister. That sucks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy by the latest happenings in Delhi. 23 of tall congress leaders met and discussed, possibly they talked about a congress without the Gandhi family. I wish a congress with a strong non dynastic but merit based leadership emerges. If that happens they can take on the BJP which is drowning India with its blind faith in Hinduism. Plus a Congress without Gandhi’s will also make some people in DMK think of a DMK without the Karunanidhi family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nation needs merit based and not bloodline based leaders if it truly needs to progress. I would also blame the voters here. I don’t vote when I am confused, I just voted once in my life when I was clear. Many people I see caste their vote to some popular party because others cast their vote to that party too. If people don’t have a clear idea, I encourage them to stay away from voting. Else if we vote blind, it’s like a bus driver driving a packed bus blind folded.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Gandhi Dynasty</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Trapped in I.T</title><link href="/2022/02/18/trapped-in-it.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Trapped in I.T" /><published>2022-02-18T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-02-18T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/02/18/trapped-in-it</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/02/18/trapped-in-it.html">&lt;p&gt;I had to install some software on my computer to start off some projects, and i was thinking of doing it today, telling it to the person who I had to report, possibly get code access today and start seeing what I will be encountering in near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s DMK rule now and there was a power cut that started at 9:30 AM, and it’s 12:30 PM and no sign of power returning yet. I have always regarded Jayalalitha as the worst leader India had ever produced, but she solved massive powercuts in Tamilnadu, when Stalin took rule there are powercuts once again. As I type this I could hear “allah ho akbar” being sang in Mosque. A institution that cheats people saying that God exists has power, but me who work my ass off, bring foreign exchange to India, say with pride that I pay more tax this year than the last am experiencing powercut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the company I code for would think if I say I have pwercut? I don’t know. A boss could be one who could understand my problem, or he could be a psychopath like one of my previous boss . Even during height of covid, my previous boss wanted a full eight hour back up installed in my home despite old people old people living with me who could contract Corona from people who are installing the backup. I was happy that I ended the project with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I.T industry is like that, usually people who did not really code, or don’t want to code, lead people who could code. And due to their ignorance of coders problems they bring down the company. May be it’s complex, people who don’t code cannot understand the complexity we fae, and we who code cannot understand why they cannot understand us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually everything that’s been done by an I.T developer is subjected to criticism, by his peers, by his boss, by client and so on. This industry has evolved in that way, I don’t think it can ever be changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mismanagement is prevalent in I.T industry. We all know Alexander is a great war lord because he fought with his soldiers, but Czar Nicolas is not because he sat and slept on decorated furniture while his men died. None mourned the death of Czar. In I.T today it’s like that, we have got mere wasteful Cazar’s leading teams. Even if they happen to die today, none would mourn their demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people who I talk to want to come out and escape I.T, but for some reason we couldn’t. It seems to be a trap. We are seduced by money that comes when we type into our terminals from our couch and bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I.T people seem to be ignorant too. Tell an I.T guy to get a gas connection, to find a rental home, most of them will be at loss. Recently one of my friends purchased a home, he signed its documents without a proper lawyer consultation. I was baffled, but he is okay about it. It’s that much ignorant I.T people are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I talk to a Bengali or Keralite, they are full of knowledge, but these two states don’t lead in I.T any way. If I talk with a person in Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore, that too one who is in I.T, that person looks damn dumb, and it’s no wonder for me that I.T companies are run in very inefficient manner, people in it are very unhappy. I don’t see such unhappiness with a Bengali or a Keralite. Clearly we in i.T are stupid and missing something essential that a human must have. I don’t know what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May be it could be the smiles of another human. I take Data Science classes, people taking it express a feeling of gratitude, and I really feel like continuing it. I write books about emerging tech, people who read it write to me something good about it, and I feel like doing it. In I.T industry that’s not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeidlz2yqx2yabgvcz67o3mrnxnpvaoqqtrcxtzeto65xgt3dyjwxga.ipfs.dweb.link/Aloo Bonda_finalforweb1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Tea &amp;amp; Bonda&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In I.T you do one thing, and there will be ten mistakes spotted just because someone wants to prove he knows something, most of the mistakes spotted will be stupid. If I open a tea bonda shop, may be one in 10 customer will complain, that is 100X improvement in satisfying human. May be that’s what I must do. All one needs is a gas connection, and not electricity to open a tea bonda shop. Tamilnadu under Stalin will not have have electricity, but it definely can supply commercial gas cylinders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s this lack of humanness in I.T industry that’s killing it. To offset it, I.T companies hire bright minds with lot of salary to endure this shit. I think bright minds should find something better, rather than code for I.T. They must seek a place where humanness exists and boycott hell.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I had to install some software on my computer to start off some projects, and i was thinking of doing it today, telling it to the person who I had to report, possibly get code access today and start seeing what I will be encountering in near future.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Did Nehru go about inaugurating Temples?</title><link href="/2022/02/07/did-nehru-go-about-inaugurating-temples.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Did Nehru go about inaugurating Temples?" /><published>2022-02-07T09:50:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-02-07T09:50:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/02/07/did-nehru-go-about-inaugurating-temples</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/02/07/did-nehru-go-about-inaugurating-temples.html">&lt;table&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Modi offering to Ramanujan statue&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modi recently inaugurated a statue of Saint Ramunajan,  Ramanujan is a well known Vaishnavite saint in south India. I am not worried what underwear Modi wears, or if he wears it or not, its his personal stuff, but if he exposes his personal stuff to India it looks ugly. Ones religion is personal stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wondered how the leaders of India (I don’t consider Modi as a leader), tried to open peoples minds. Take for instance Nehru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Jnehru.jpg/501px-Jnehru.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Jawaharlal Nehru&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I duckduckgoed about Nehru inaugurations, I found these pictures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeieyitmhrybyyv3efzmtudzzi2got4q6dlnyba7cjpfxtpwomebq4i.ipfs.dweb.link/nehru-opens-dam.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Nehru opens a dam&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above one is a picture of Nehru opening a dam, and the below one is Nehru with Vickram Sarabhai, the man who was instrumental in creating ISRO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeif5mkte2fkciwf47kxj4sufnmf3ykpcfzzmujo7a35eev6uu7m6wu.ipfs.dweb.link/131080-jcrgwwvakb-1605276168.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Nehru with Vickram Sarabhai&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nehru opened institutions and infrastructure that improved lives of people, that used Science &amp;amp; Technology to seek and find out mysteries of this universe or possibly multiverse. He was intelligent and never would want to fool people by associating with a particular religion. He made sure that he never promoted God, thus fooling people to think God exists. He might or might not have belived in God, but he made sure he never made a fool of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;congress-lost&quot;&gt;Congress Lost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress started as a religious party, it was they who pioneered bringing idol of lord Ganesh to roads. They knew religion is a powerful force. But then somehow something good happened, congress got bright minds and an air of secularism settled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then look at congress now, below you can see a picture of Manmohan and Sonia Gandhi paying respect to Saiababa’s dead body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeibrsbypjatdxfxzvpgszijjoutrgvevk55iqp25rcfgphb7wzkary.ipfs.dweb.link/del473378.webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Manmohan and Sonia Gandhi paying respect to Saiababa’s dead body&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did congress get lost? I am not sure. Where it’s intellectual’s went? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact Saibaba is a mere magician who used his tricks to deceive people that he had grace of God. If God really exists, why it would give grace to one or two and not all? May be God believers don’t have brains enough to think like that and hence most people will never think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the opposition is weak, and can’t hold up to it’s moral values, I wonder how they can question Modi?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;india-a-nation-of-science-or-just-a-hindu-pakistan&quot;&gt;India a nation of Science or just a Hindu Pakistan?&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Pakistan a nation destroyed by Islam&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is a religious nation that does not want to develop. We are Indian’s, we created our nation to be secular, its up to us to choose the right leader. Do we want our kids life’s to be better, and do we want Science, Knowledge, progress, this giving us happy and comfortable life? Or dow we want to be just another Hindu Pakistan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember Pakistan is a nation that is currently a burden to this planet and nothing else because they will never improve because of their religion. One must remember that Nepal and Bangladesh have shed their religions and have modernized.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Modi offering to Ramanujan statue</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Getting Clojupyter running</title><link href="/programming/clojure/clojupyter/2022/02/04/getting-clojupyter-running.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Getting Clojupyter running" /><published>2022-02-04T11:48:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-02-04T11:48:00+05:30</updated><id>/programming/clojure/clojupyter/2022/02/04/getting-clojupyter-running</id><content type="html" xml:base="/programming/clojure/clojupyter/2022/02/04/getting-clojupyter-running.html">&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many programmers I fell in love with Clojure. Before I fell in love with Ruby and this framework Ruby on Rails, but when I worked in companies like a big corp , I encountered Rails apps with 0.2 million lines of code, having no test, thus practically unmaintainable, my boss was finding scapegoats to blame and was firing people. To mitigate the slow development speeds, a project that could have been done with 3 - 5 people had kind of 10+ developers, a dozen or so testers, and huge ops team! Yes that’s right. Ruby on Rails was supposed be a cost effective framework which few people could use to create great apps, but here they used lot of people to create a waste and muddled app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I desperately wanted a maintainable code and I landed up on Clojure and I am learning it. One advantage of Clojure is, if you know it well, you can use ClojureScript instead of JavaScript. Framework like Ruby on Rails does not promise you out of the box that you can replace JavaScript, JavaScript an ill made up language that gives pain to developers, and hence should be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with Clojure using Clojupyter that runs on Jupyter notebook, and it was very good. It’s like REPL on steroids. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter/blob/master/doc/conda-installing.md#using-conda-installing-clojupyter&quot;&gt;installed it with conda&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems to work all well. Than I got this error all of a sudden:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been very long since I worked with Java and I couldn’t find head or tail of it. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://clojureverse.org/t/unable-to-work-with-clojupyter/8554&quot;&gt;asked it in ClojureVerse&lt;/a&gt;, none responded. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter/issues/159&quot;&gt;put it in Clojupyter github&lt;/a&gt;, and none responded. I was bit desperate, here was a language that seemed to be good, and it could harness the power of Jupyter, so learning could be fast, but I wasn’t getting enough help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a Rubyist, the Ruby community is very good, you get response in your emails if you poat a problems, perhaps that’s not the case yet with Clojure community, that’s sad. I wish it improves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter/issues/159&quot;&gt;used Clojupyter as library&lt;/a&gt; and it worked! I hope it doesnt’t screw up. First I got something like zeqomq error, but then when I did &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;conda upgrade ipykernel&lt;/code&gt;, it got fixed. I got a help from &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitanswer.com/spyder-error-tornado-general-uncaught-exception-in-zmqstream-callback-306179886&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now I am okay, but it would be great if clojure community is becomes more helpful in the future. Right now I feel barrier for entry into Clojure, despite the language’s simplicity is high.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Clojupyter Logo</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">When Devise sign_in, sign_up does not work with RSpec request spec</title><link href="/web%20development/ruby%20on%20rails/devise/tdd/rspec/2022/01/28/when-devise-sign-in-sign-up-does-not-work-with-rspec-request-spec.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="When Devise sign_in, sign_up does not work with RSpec request spec" /><published>2022-01-28T20:46:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-01-28T20:46:00+05:30</updated><id>/web%20development/ruby%20on%20rails/devise/tdd/rspec/2022/01/28/when-devise-sign-in-sign-up-does-not-work-with-rspec-request-spec</id><content type="html" xml:base="/web%20development/ruby%20on%20rails/devise/tdd/rspec/2022/01/28/when-devise-sign-in-sign-up-does-not-work-with-rspec-request-spec.html">&lt;p&gt;I was updating a Rails 6 project, there were som technical debt, I needed to remove or make failing tests pass. When I was trying to fix request spect, I found out that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sign_in&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sign_up&lt;/code&gt; devise helpers did not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after reading Devise documentation I could not make it work. It turns out that we need &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IntegrationHelpers&lt;/code&gt; to be added for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;request&lt;/code&gt;. So in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;spec/rails_helper.rb&lt;/code&gt;, add the following lines after &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;require &apos;rspec/rails&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;RSpec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Devise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ControllerHelpers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;type: :controller&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Devise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ControllerHelpers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;type: :view&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Devise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;IntegrationHelpers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;type: :feature&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Devise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;IntegrationHelpers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;type: :request&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it should work fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thing you must note is this line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Devise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;IntegrationHelpers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;type: :request&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where we make &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IntegrationHelpers&lt;/code&gt; available in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; spec.&lt;/p&gt;

Before that I have been an embedded systems programmer, to code a microcontroller and not knowing what its really intended for was a wreak on my soul. I am a guy who though belies there is no purpose in life, nothing is constant, and everything is meaningless, strangely seek for a purpose of my actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left big corporates, and not knowing what HTML is, I stated creating websites for people and businesses, and I was successful. People said there is a miracle stuff called PHP, and I am just using plain HTML to create websites, I learned PHP and it improved my productivity a lot. I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I came to know about this programming language called Ruby, I tried it out. Boy I was blown away. I thought PHP was super productive compared to C and Java, but Ruby was not even next, it was way way way far ahead. There was this framework Ruby on Rails, I failed to learn it many times, but eventually I mastered it. It immensely increased my productivity, a months job in PHP was just day in Ruby on Rails!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails before Version 4 also eliminated a pain point, it was called JavaScript. A very poorly designed language (and it’s still poorly designed), it was pain to use. Rails people built a  wonderful library called Prototype and Scriptaculous, and they wrote a Ruby wrapper called Rails Java Script which encapsulated the dirtiness of JavaScript. It was all great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came in jQuery, it was JavaScript-ish which made us shed tears but Rails also included Coffeescript, which removed some pain of writing JavaScript. Though Rails was bit rotting away from its promise, it was okay because of Coffeescript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then for some reason around Rails 6 Cofeescript was kind of stopped working, currently I am using jQuery and vanilla JavaScript to write my front end, and it bit sucks. Plus I have to deal with all this webpacker comedy which makes app development immensely complex!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rails 7 I guess webpacker and nodejs are kind of pushed away and people say its good, but I am still trialing out before I recommend it to my customers. Rails still advocates using JavaScript, which frankly sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am exploring Clojure and ClojureScript, just to escape the menace of creating apps using JavaScript. I was also attracted to Microsoft’s Blazor framework where we can code everything with C#, but then which one having brains will ever trust Microsoft?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one area I have missed exploring or to be frank haven’t explored because it seems not to integrate with Rails well is Opal. I truly wished Rails embraced Opal, and we need not touch JavaScript ever again, but then for some reason it did not happen.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rxlJRydqmk8?color=white&amp;amp;theme=light&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/iframe&gt;
     &lt;/figure&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any way let me come to the point of this blog. I want to tell the world why I think its super silly to have a JavaScript framework. Well here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeicoq5sm36a62eqzxzzotv25mlshgi4sxqauiknnpancvkjuw66g7u.ipfs.dweb.link/silliness-of-js-framework-Page-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We store data mostly in  a system called RDBMS, and its major role is store, and retrieve data thats all. It was created to be very efficient for that. It wasn’t created to generate a HTML document that could be served as web page, plus it’s not created to be immensely secure. One wrong query could destroy an entire app and the Database. So we have this red thing in middle called the Web Framework that makes sure that some user action won’t trigger a query that destroys the business, and it retrieves data from the browser, stores it in the DB and get’s the data from the DB, generates a HTML and sends it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeifkayqteg26g4ayrtlsrwax7a5tzuwsvgyp6243oqoq7ftyplar6a.ipfs.dweb.link/silliness-of-js-framework-Page-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now look at the above picture, you have inserted a JavaScript framework in between and you send JSON back and forth to the web framework and JavaScript framework converts to HTML. That kind of sucks. You are adding an extra layer just for nothing! That to me is really really stupid and could be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-big-tech-promotes-this-approach&quot;&gt;Why big tech promotes this approach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In big tech, what looks good on paper, getting approvals from various levels for your idea, a tech guy looking good on paper and his survival is important than solving problems that humans face. So they tend to do what looks good on paper. Look at the diagram below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeibb3qpo7z3ewspq7us5spphblc5rmusupatzvg42lcoj6lu4po3fm.ipfs.dweb.link/silliness-of-js-framework-Big-Tech-Arch.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see a nice front end, a nice back end and they are connected by JSON. The front end could be a mobile or  website running on a desktop, the back end could be written in any language and they are connected by this JSON which provides good abstraction. On paper this looks clean. For an inexperienced it looks good. So they get this stuff approved. They claim it’s an innovative way of doing things. Since they are big tech, they can afford to develop new front end frameworks which suits their thought at that time. They could hire big teams who would take care of front end, back end, a team to look at the architecture and synchronization between them and can handle all such complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now consider us, most of the tech guys who service clients. Now think, are we here to solve some ones problems with tech or spend multiple millions on advertising saying that we are on the bleeding edge? Think if we have the man power or the money to pay big teams which can take on this architecture? Think is it worth the effort to convert website data to JSON to Database rows and vice versa?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most tech people think what’s been done in big tech is right because big tech has more money. Why don’t they think big tech has more money and hence they can afford to be inefficient? Most developers fall into this trap, they learn some front end framework, they put it on their resume so that it looks cool, and their life follows resume driven development approach to their grave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s for you to ask yourself, did you become a tech guy to solve peoples problems using tech? Or are you here just because you are here and are okay to go with what ever is thrown at you?&lt;/p&gt;
