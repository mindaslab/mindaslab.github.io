&lt;p&gt;We in India make fun of Pakistan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar. These regions take religion as truth and prefer to stay backward for generations to come. If you are one such person and living in Tamilnadu and thinking Tamilnadu is a progressive state, watch the video above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are gangs in Tamilnadu that take ancient Hindu verses as truth and want to take us backwards. They have a huge following. The followings are so foolish that they believe in God, miracle, supernatural forces etc. These followings think that God is better worshipped not in Tamil, or ones mother tongue, but they believe God is better worshipped with an extinct language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These groups believe in caste, religion, and segregation of people. In short, they are threat to nation that emphasizes equality of all humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Your browser does not support the video element.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A to Z Pyramid in Ruby</title><link href="/2022/08/26/a-to-z-pyramid-in-ruby.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A to Z Pyramid in Ruby" /><published>2022-08-26T22:22:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-08-26T22:22:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/08/26/a-to-z-pyramid-in-ruby</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/08/26/a-to-z-pyramid-in-ruby.html">&lt;p&gt;I was contacted by some one on the Internet to print a pyramid from A to Z which has the following pattern:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s Tamilnadu’s finance minister P.T.R.Palanivel Thiyagarajan demolishing the BJP and Modi’s economics. The BJP has no response to it other than mud slinging or diversionary talk, hiring people to throw slippers at P.T.R as protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BJP is old school, telling people to read Sanksrit, and old Hindu text and promising a miracle will come out of it. P.T.R is a man of data, he uses statistics to justify himself. Rather than we Indians seeing this as a war between P.T.R and BJP, we must see it as a war between statistician / economist with data and people of blind faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way the BJP to come out of this mess is to drop this individual Modi worship stuff, they must drop this Hindutva stuff, and truly become Bharitya Janatha Party, a party that really strives in a scientific way, backed by data and experiments to improve the life of people. Right now they are too stupid to reform. It’s we people who must vote out Modi and bring in intelligent people to power for our nation to prosper.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Imagine the Taliban talking about good governance.

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got fed up, I wanted to create a 2 folders inside a folder, and a file inside one of the subfolder. I searched and could not get a GNU/Linux command for it, so I wanted to create my own tool and so created &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/mindaslab/mk3&quot;&gt;mk3 or make tree&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gitlab.com/mindaslab/mk3/-/raw/master/mk3-logo.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I tried to write code for it, I got it all wrong, I took a break concentrated on other activities and the code just appeared out of nowhere. This time it took in account the power of Ruby programming language’s latest features, I coded it, and it worked like charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time, for very complex stuff I would go on to a state where I would just eat, watch T.V with chips, just do nothing, watch music video’s keep playing games. Sometimes I get flashes where I can see the code I imagined first getting refined, then that moment comes, may be every after 2 or 3 lazy days, the perfect answer. I would code it and it would work. It would take into account all the files I have checked to learn about the issue. It’s like magic, the Qui of coding. I don’t know how it works, but it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The I.T industry still thinks coding is like tightening bolts in a factory. No matter how modern a company wants to be seen, they want people to say how long they have worked. That’s rubbish I say. Have we found a way to meter thought? Have we found a way to continuously monitor brains energy usage? Have we found a way to measure efficiency of one brains neural structure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was once in a company called Zanec, my friends used to say a guy called Varadharajan used to sit behind me and note what I was doing, I used to watch music videos to clear off my brain for the Qui to happen, that poor guy might have not programmed in his life, he thought programming productivity was linearly proportional to the time spent before computers and chugging the keyboard. Thinking of those days brings me laughter. It also angers me to think how may life’s that guy had spoiled. But people like that survive in I.T companies where percapita employee productivity and earning is very low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I coded for another company Lumera, where it’s boss Venkatesh required us to have four meetings a day, one at morning 10:30 where we need to say what we plan to do today, at 2PM where we need to say what we have achieved till now, and I think at 5:30 PM for another status meeting. Apart from that we had a meeting at 7:30PM with client. It was hell coding there. You were under constant pressure to prepare for your speeches at the meeting. Apart from that if I said something if the boss did not like I need to have another calls with him which will drag and drag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeie4c32bfmlwnzn4hyb2kbym4y5wqydrpibbqy4rp2ddmkptfkyhaq.ipfs.dweb.link/garfield-eats.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the person who had worked there also told me that the boss called her and told that she should not have lunch breaks more than 30 minutes. A foodie herself she was put down. I also wished he told us how much time we could pee and poo. Another guy said, before I could join there, there will be a live Zoom call from 2PM - 4PM where they have to turn cameras on and code so that the boss can watch, so they do not sleep after lunch. Sadly though the company made money, it was very unproductive, made things insanely complicated, and hence people felt content putting a lot of effort into code to make small things happen and felt great about doing lot of inefficient work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I authored a tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doneit.in&quot;&gt;doneit&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a work logging app. I initially gave free trails to my friends, many of them came back to me and said it has got no way to log time, then “how can we measure productivity?” they asked. I sweet talked them, put down the phone, banged my head and felt sorry for the people who work under them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In I.T industry, when it comes to programming, the measure of productivity is what you have done, it doesn’t matter about the time. Your code should be understandable and scalable. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure how many programmers out there are working under non programming bosses who still have the industrial age mindset. I pity them, but to be productive, be shameless in the number of breaks you take and the time you take for breaks. Your brain is processing stuff subconsciously, and it will come out with the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Where is the terrorism defeating Prime Minister?</title><link href="/2022/08/11/where-is-the-terrorism-defeating-prime-minister.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Where is the terrorism defeating Prime Minister?" /><published>2022-08-11T10:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-08-11T10:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/08/11/where-is-the-terrorism-defeating-prime-minister</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/08/11/where-is-the-terrorism-defeating-prime-minister.html">&lt;table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I woke up, a bankrupt, backward, nation Pakistan which was created on basis of 2000 year old outdated good for nothing book, a nation where even dogs and pigs don’t prefer to live has successfully attacked Indian army base. We in India who can’t even stop an infiltration call ourselves a superpower. Needless to say I am writing this blog after a power cut that happened in my home in Chennai. Such is the amount of lies, corruption, bribery goes on here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the intelligent prime minister who said that demonetization will end terrorism, and if it does not one must burn him alive. He still lives well, we see his personal fortune has increased, and still lot of people believe him as the savior of India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nation like America is able to kill terrorist Osama Bin Laden in Abbotabad (Pakistan) and Ayman al-Zawahri in Kabul (Afghanistan), they are able to do it from 1000’s of miles away. We call ourselves as superpower and are powerless when a mad and bankrupt nation attacks us. Even tiny Israel is able to strike at its opponents, whereas India which has tens of states far larger and more populated than Israel is able to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a blog not aimed at politicians, you simply can’t change them, once in power, the rich corrupt them with money, they distance them from people. This is just my rant, and hopefully a blog to make people think. Think what is the necessity of Pakistan? Why is that Muslims can’t live in a Muslim minority nation? Why was our land divided? Why have we not taken control of our land just because people in it call themselves as different nation and kill us when they want? Why are we a toothless tiger?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Mother India</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">jQuery is still the 👑 King</title><link href="/2022/08/04/jquery-is-still-the-king.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="jQuery is still the 👑 King" /><published>2022-08-04T00:11:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-08-04T00:11:00+05:30</updated><id>/2022/08/04/jquery-is-still-the-king</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/08/04/jquery-is-still-the-king.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-bulma-with-rails-7&quot;&gt;Using Bulma with Rails 7&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a new app idea in my mind. I have been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; all along, but this time I wanted to try something different. I was scouting for front end CSS frameworks and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bulma.io&quot;&gt;bulma&lt;/a&gt; caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was easy to integrate bulma into new Rails 7 app, you just need to specify you want css as bulma as shown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ rails new app_name -css=bulma
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I do not know how to add it to an already existing Rails app. All this node 🤮 and JavaScript 🤮🤮 is super confusing to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bulma had a good nav bar and it was responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bafybeif52dkezpfpltkigy7phivgfp6arkmyxchytbh4nghkgz6fxksegy.ipfs.dweb.link/bulma-nav-burger.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hid its menus in mobile view and you can reveal it by clicking a burger menu as shown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bulmas-burger-toggle&quot;&gt;Bulmas Burger toggle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To toggle this burger, bulma gave two piece of code, this one is in JavaScript 🤮🤮:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JavaScript 🤮🤮&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;DOMContentLoaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Get all &quot;navbar-burger&quot; elements&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$navbarBurgers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;.navbar-burger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Add a click event on each of them&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$navbarBurgers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;el&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Get the target from the &quot;data-target&quot; attribute&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dataset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Toggle the &quot;is-active&quot; class on both the &quot;navbar-burger&quot; and the &quot;navbar-menu&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;is-active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;is-active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is in jQuery:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;jQuery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Check for click events on the navbar burger icon&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;.navbar-burger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Toggle the &quot;is-active&quot; class on both the &quot;navbar-burger&quot; and the &quot;navbar-menu&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;.navbar-burger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toggleClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;is-active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;.navbar-menu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toggleClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;is-active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don’t know why crack heads even in Rails community want to use pure JavaScript 🤮🤮, just look at the jQuery code. It’s small and does the job. jQuery is still the king when it comes to JavaScript 🤮🤮. It’s small, better to writer, and get’s the job done! It’s the King!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for this blog. If you want to learn how I achieved navbar burger toggle for my website continue reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;navbar-burger-toggle-in-bulma&quot;&gt;Navbar burger toggle in bulma&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First start a webpage with CSS as bulma as shown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ rails new app_name -css=bulma
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rails 7, if you do &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rails s&lt;/code&gt;, server will run and it will be served in port 3000, but if you make changes to CSS, it won’t reflect. You must use a command as shown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ bin/dev
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The command above taps into &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Procfile.dev&lt;/code&gt;, which has the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;web: bin/rails server -p 3000
js: yarn build --watch
css: yarn build:css --watch
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and starts 3 processes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;web: bin/rails server -p 3000&lt;/code&gt; is for the Rails app to be served on port 3000&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;js: yarn build --watch&lt;/code&gt; is to watch the JavaScript 🤮🤮 files and to compile them when they are changed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;css: yarn build:css --watch&lt;/code&gt; is to watch the CSS files and to compile them when they are changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I added jQuery using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; as shown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ yarn add jquery
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a file &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app/javascript/add_jquery.js&lt;/code&gt; which had the following content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;jquery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;jquery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;jQuery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;jquery&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;jquery&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To toggle the navbar burger I created a a file &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app/javascript/navbar-burger.js&lt;/code&gt; and it had the following content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Check for click events on the navbar burger icon&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;.navbar-burger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Toggle the &quot;is-active&quot; class on both the &quot;navbar-burger&quot; and the &quot;navbar-menu&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;.navbar-burger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toggleClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;is-active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;.navbar-menu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toggleClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;is-active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see, this is different than the one given in bulma website. The reason is Rails kind of act’s like single page app, so if you use the bulmas way, the burger will not toggle when the navbar is loaded via ajax request. Wheras my code will make that possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I need to tell &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app/javascript/application.js&lt;/code&gt; to include jQuery and my navbar-burger code to toggle navber burger:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Entry point for the build script in your package.json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;@hotwired/turbo-rails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;./controllers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;./add_jquery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;./navbar-burger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it, any navbar put in any page in your Rails app will toggle the burger in mobile view. Enjoy!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phew 😮‍💨, when the hell A.I systems will code and save us from JavaScript 🤮🤮 and other configuration nonsense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we heard a story that some contrives don’t permit patents designed by A.I agent, so we need to file it as we humans invented it. While trying to file it, in the first screens we noted this option:&lt;/p&gt;
