    <p>Itâ€™s been 75 years since we got our freedom, yet slavery mentality still persists in our country. Just look at the police force in Tamilnadu for example. They killed fellow people in Thutukudi and still the killers are out. The person who told to kill them Eddapaadi Palani Sami and Vedanta group are untouched. Even today while I was in Medavakkam I saw a car with government sticker and blue, red LEDâ€™s flashing, looks like a cop or some government employee wants to show off that he is above a normal citizen.</p>

<p>Government people are untalented ones and donâ€™t have any skills, their only skill is to exploit the nation and become wealthy. Because of that they want to feel superior and exploit us. Thatâ€™s natural behavior of pea brained people, we can do nothing about it. Only if intelligent people come into the government offices things will change.</p>

<p>Unlike the government, one might think Info Tech companies are said to formed by intelligent and decent people, thatâ€™s not true, there are slave companies in I.T industry as well. Here is how to identify them.</p>

<h2 id="indian-companies">Indian Companies</h2>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/41/Flag_of_India.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Indian companies are the ones that have pride in them. The pride I mean is not to say that they serve such a such client, but they pride their Indian workers. Pride I mean is not marketing pride, but financial pride. They pay Indians the same as western counterparts. Indian companies concentrate on quality of code than making one work hard, toil for long and deliver a lot of crap low quality cheap code.</p>

<p>Indian companies cultivate skills for their employees and make them valuable. They make their employees enjoy and live life. They bring more money into India by getting more salary for Indians, thus boosting the economy from its roots.</p>

<h2 id="slave-companies">Slave Companies</h2>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/IJzeren_voetring_voor_gevangenen_transparent_background.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Slave companies are the ones that encourage you to work more and more. For them the colonial mentality is fixed, so the western client is always right. These companies are nothing more than slave brokers to the white man and the rich. They bow only to the clients money and pay no attention to your skill.</p>

<p>Slave companies say the company is great all the time, but during the time of appraisal the company will become so poor that it canâ€™t give you a decent raise. These companies are only useful to propagate the colonial and slavery mentality in India, and are super dangerous cancer to our nation.</p>

<h2 id="so">Soâ€¦..</h2>

<p>Do you work in an Indian company?</p>
