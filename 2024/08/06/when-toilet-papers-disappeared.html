    <p>Usually itâ€™s assumed that the intelligent and capable will lead, but in reality itâ€™s not. I can assure about that in the I.T industry. When ever I asked doubts to my higher up, they with confidence will say this is the path forward. Iâ€™m coding for 20+ years, if I ask doubt, it means that I have to log I have done something today, itâ€™s mandatory in most companies to log something everyday, when I donâ€™t want to work, I ask doubt. I donâ€™t even listen to what shit people talk, I read the code and fix it. Code is truth for me.</p>

<p>Another thing in the I.T industry that appears now and then is frugality. Recently it looks like my friendsâ€™ office is not giving free biriyani and pizzas during meetings. Thatâ€™s bad, I.T companies never want us to be frugal with work, but for some reason they have the god given right to go frugal anytime they want. Yet the non-working top brass will fly here and there in biz class, stay in expensive hotels, goto bars, and even take their family to European trips.</p>

<p>I was in a company Zanec, things were going well, though the company had huge politics, my client Mr. Joe Mathew of Software Worx seem to be saving me now and then and kept me afloat, else Zanec was near shit. As shit as most software firms. It was not created because someone loved technology and wanted to make peopleâ€™s lifeâ€™s better, it was created because a management could make money by brokering work for people.</p>

<p>The company hit hard times, the company employed a very nasty guy called Varadharajan who would annoy people enough so that they would leave. This way the company saved 2 months of pay check which they need to give when they fired people. Actually such kind of frugal stuff is employed by most companies. When I worked in HCL technologies, I think from 2004 - 2006, itâ€™s HR Mr. Nandhakumar talked to me and made me leave. Same stuff happened to me in Navigant, where my boss Suresh Vasudev and HR Shyam tortured me so that I left. Even Zanec employed a person called Anu Balaji who would annoy me, and finally make me leave. Over here I must appreciate the company Francium, they had hard times, they fire me, at least for me, they gave some compensation. But usually I.T companies are fraud.</p>

<p>This is why I tell many people in west, if you are giving project to Indian companies, check how ethical they are. Else if the project goes well, ask the guy who is working in the company to directly work for you, so that the person has a chance to escape if he is in high politics environment, and by cutting out the middle man, one could save money.</p>

<p>Now lets comeback to Zanec. As the company was crumbling, we suddenly notice there was no toilet paper. There was no paper near the hand wash, and in the toilets. A person called Ravi, I think he is the director, would lecture us how we are going eco-friendly without the toilet papers. Damn.</p>

<p>Anyway, I did not endure this stupidity long, like Kaikeiyi poisoned by Manthara, poisoned by Varadharajan, Anu Balaji pitched in, gave me a hard time, I left and life did become better. Never be frugal in cultivating your skills, itâ€™s only skill and truthfulness will save you.</p>
