    <p>It takes good education and freedom of thought to see through the glare. For millennium we Indians were made to believe a ruler, be it ancient Kings, the British or the bogus democracy called India. At least now, in the time of crisis, I am happy that people of Chennai have stopped trusting the government.</p>

<h2 id="mudichur-being-vacated">Mudichur being vacated</h2>

<p>People of Mudichur, near Tambaram are vacating their homes because of rain warning. I think it was flooded atleast twice in the past, the government did nothing about it. Now rather than being there under the reign of unhelpful government, people are abandoning that place. Thats good.</p>

<h2 id="parking-on-velacherrys-bridge">Parking on Velacherryâ€™s bridge</h2>

<p>Many people have parked their cars on Velacherry bridge to avoid the vechiles from getting drowned. They are not believing the fucking Tamilnadu governments Chennai flood control system. We know who comes to power in Tamilnadu, and how they come tp power. Is it because of merit? Is it because that person has done something good to the nation? No. No. We all know how.</p>

<p>I wonder how people even bought property in Velacherry? It is bough area and naturally it will get flooded. I wonder why the government even allowed people to settle there? I still feel strongly that Velacherry and Pallikaranai should be returned back to nature.</p>

<p>To return back to nature, the Tamilnadu government should stop all registration of properties in that region, so no new real estate activity takes place. This will plunge the value of property over there. The government I feel should put restriction to stop any human building activity. May be in the span of 100 years it will become a swamp again and would absorb some amount of floods Chennai gets in future.</p>

<p>May be the citizens of Velacherry can sue Chennai corporation of Cheating them, making them believe that Velacherry is a habitable area, thus draining their millions. I wish the court will force the government to buy back the property from people in Velacherry.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>I think 20cm of rain per day in Chennai is drainable (thatâ€™s what government claims, we do not know how much corruption and malpractice are involved), the question is why not 40cm?</p>

<p>Is Chennai storing rain water to be used in drought months? If not, why?</p>

<p>How much water is sent to the ocean? Why?</p>

<p>Why Chennai can host a F4 car race, air show, but not fend of flooding? Itâ€™s just water that comes down, not molten metal. Are we so tech incompetant?</p>

<p>There are so many engineering colleges in and around Chennai, are they sleeping? Why can they even publish a proposal? If they canâ€™t whatâ€™s the use of their existence?</p>

<h2 id="quit-chennai">Quit Chennai</h2>

<p>If such incompetent, corrupt governments are ruling Chennai, people think, why you should buy a property in Chennai? Why you must work here with higher spending, higher pollution, higher risk of floods, murders and rowdyism, drugs and intolerable traffic, garbage, stray dogs and cows to name a few? Why canâ€™t we have stable power supply, in rain? Why are we so weak in technology to achieve these?</p>
