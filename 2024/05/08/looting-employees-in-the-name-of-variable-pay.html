    <p>Some companies have this concept of variable pay. They say this is your salary, and then they say this much is what you get because other part is a variable pay. Then they have cheated you. They have told an amount, but have effectively reduced your salary by play of words. I wonder what the labor minister in India does even if such practices are done on huge scale, costing the country crores?</p>

<p>Another way companies loot employees in the name of variable pay is, they give the variable pay. Let me say how itâ€™s looting. Letâ€™s say I should have got a pay of Rs 10,000/- last month, but I am getting it after 3 months, since itâ€™s variable. Now, letâ€™s do the math. If I put 18% pa as interest, for a month I would have earned Rs 10149.99/-, that is about Rs 150/- as interest. Now compounding this for 3 months, it would be Rs 10456.78/-, or I had lost Rs 456.78/-, the company since itâ€™s doing business, it would have made far more money by holding my variable pay.</p>

<p>Even though company makes this money, company does not give me the right of ownership, voting rights or nothing. They just loot me and make money out of it. In fact its looting of Indianâ€™s in broad daylight.</p>

<p><strong>Will The Government Wake Up?</strong></p>

<p>This variable pay thing is happening in lots of offices. Itâ€™s a blatant loot of Indiaâ€™s labor force, itâ€™s a form of cheating. Will the sleeping government of India wake up and make it illegal?</p>
