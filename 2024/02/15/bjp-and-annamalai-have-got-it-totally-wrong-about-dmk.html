<p>S.Ve.Sekar when speaking about Annamalai said that he is no more than a poop of an insect. Despite all the scenes he puts, thatâ€™s what Annamalai is, a nothing. Maybe he is leader of Tamilnadu BJP because he might be praising Modi a lot when he meets him. In this blog I will say why Annamalai and BJP has got it totally wrong when it comes to DMK.</p>

<h2 id="failed-it-raids">Failed I.T Raids</h2>

<p>Senthil Balajiâ€™s arrests and other things by the BJP, like raiding of DMK supporting businesses are not for quelling corruption I think, I think BJP wantâ€™s to talk with DMK to get some political mileage in Tamilnadu, and DMK isnâ€™t talking with BJP. I feel DMK Sending message to BJP that its funding is not dented. The menu of youth wing DMKâ€™s gathering recently where the family shamelessly fielded Inbha Nidhi says it, it was a rich menu.</p>

<p>I favor a corruption less DMK and I feel what BJP is doing to end DMKâ€™s corruption is not enough. Even the recent dusting of 2G files I feel is not to punish Raja and Karunanidhi family and bring justice, I feel its just for political mileage.</p>

<h2 id="dmk-saved-hinduism">DMK Saved Hinduism</h2>

<p>The speech that triggered off this blog was made by Annamalai, he said DMK is a party against God. Sure DMK is a party whoâ€™s core philosophy should be atheism, but I feel it has lost it. Duraimurugan is a bakth of this fraud Puttabathi Sai Baba, lotâ€™s of God believers are in DMK. In fact DMK is refining Hinduism and is saving it, rather than letting it get destroyed.</p>

<p>Today in Tamilnadu poosaariâ€™s are telling chants in Tamil rather than Sanskrit. We as Tamilians are able to understand it. We no longer feel that the God that can have rituals performed in our language as a foreign God.</p>

<p>In Hinduism, God is equal for all, anyone can do pooja for him / her, DMK has broken the myth that priests in Temples should only be brahmin. Anyone from any caste can become a priest. I would like DMK to amend a law where women and transgenders could become priests, I hope one day that will happen.</p>

<p>I feel Hinduism should go one step ahead and make people from any religion become priest of Hindu temples. Our Gods are there for everyone, so all have the right to access our gods and become priests.</p>

<p>DMK is also freeing up temple properties which was dominated and used by few elite, and its been made as a part of temple trust and property of the state.</p>

<p>Without knowing these, Annamalai saying that DMK is going against God is laughable. This shows how much Annamalai and BJP have studied the DMK. Looks like they have not done good work to go against the ruling party with facts.</p>

<h2 id="jallikattu">Jallikattu</h2>

<p>Jallikattu is a Tamil Hindu festival, while BJP was in power, and while ADMK (EPS) was in power in state, they tried to ban it, students protested it. DMK was not invited for the protest as it was pure citizen protest, but DMK supported it from outside. That sentiment must have had reverberations in Tamil heartland and DMK swept polls. BJP which does say itâ€™s for Hinduism was hell bent on banning this Tamil and Hindu festival.</p>

<h2 id="animal-sacrifices">Animal Sacrifices</h2>

<p>When Jayalalitha (ADMK) was in power, I think while BJP ruling was in central, and while Karunanidhi was in active politics, Jaya banned slaughtering animals in Tamples. A direct attack on Hindu sentiments. I think DMK stood for peoples sentiments though its core philosophy is atheism.</p>

<h2 id="why-religion-should-be-eliminated">Why religion Should be eliminated?</h2>

<p>Religion should be eliminated because we have better explanation of how things work than saying God created it that way. I personally feel Periyaarâ€™s way must win for a society if that society wants to improve, but I donâ€™t think Tamils are ready and knowledgeable enough for a massive change to atheism and science driven society. At the same time we canâ€™t let society drench in religion and blind faith and become a heavy sponge.</p>

<p>I feel DMK has understood that first religion (Hinduism) should be reformed to modern times, people who were oppressed by religion should be brought up, they must be told they are equal to all, they must be given education, women who are subjugated by religion should be freed, made to work, and slowly as they learn about the world, and get knowledge, they will rely on their brains than mythical God, Satan or what ever to better their lives.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-should-be-eliminated">How it should be eliminated?</h3>

<p>The best way to eliminate religion is not the way China does, forcing thought into people:</p>

<div class="video">
    <figure>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WmId2ZP3h0c?color=white&amp;theme=light" allowfullscreen="">
     </iframe>
     </figure>
     </div>

<p>But its by educating people so that they can learn and make judgement better. First people should have confidence, to build it leaders like Periyaar despite their apprehensions towards religion they worked for all to be welcomed in Temples, this gives confidence to people and makes them come up in life which ultimately leads to questioning, thus paving the way of elimination of religion.</p>

<h2 id="how-dmk-will-fall">How DMK will fall?</h2>

<p>Annamalai cannot bring fall to DMK as of now. DMK I feel will destroy itself, it has rich and elite as leaders who are disconnected from people. These elite are only interested in serving the DMK family and support its dynastic politics. If there balloons a party which cares about people, then DMK is gone.</p>

<p>Despite we Tamils knowing that DMK and ADMK parties are  ultra corrupt, there are no credible challengers today. BJP being a collection of idiots are no match for it.</p>

<h2 id="who-should-you-vote">Who should you vote?</h2>

<p>If you are a Tamil and are feeling helpless, there is not much you can do. Tamils are corrupt, and they will vote for money without having the idea what it does for the nation. But if you care something for this nation, then vote for Naam Tamizhar or Pazha Karuppiahâ€™s party. I wish you vote for Karuppiahâ€™s party since Naam Tamizhar hold up a terrorist as their icon. They could be radicals. If Karuppiahâ€™s party is not standing this Parliament Election, better go for Naam Tamizhar.</p>
