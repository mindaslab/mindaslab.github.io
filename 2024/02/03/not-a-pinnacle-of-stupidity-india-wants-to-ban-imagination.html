<p>If evolution had consciousness, Modi, RSS, BJP, Indian bureaucrats would be a great embarrassment, evolution will commit suicide to have created people like these. I think it was in Modiâ€™s rule, suddenly github was banned in India, in Modiâ€™s rule bitcoin is facing serious problems just because Modi wants his friends but not the people of India to control money and economy. We still see people trying to convert Mosques to Temples, though we know such process of converting religious places is barbaric, and we know eye for an eye will surely make the world blind. Somehow psychopaths and people who cannot think and connect with our people have become our leaders, India is still in its dark ages.</p>

<p>I think Indian politicians are only fit to boast themselves off, being pea brained they have got no ability to think Information Technology is a product of human nature. Humans like to find out facts, imagine and share them with one another. Or maybe it looks like Modi wants an audience with Rashmika Mandana.</p>

<div class="video">

    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OJvEta1rkyI?color=white&amp;theme=light" allowfullscreen="">

<p>Some guy imagined how it would for Rashmika have a great boobs, found a nice body for her face and told his neural network to merge it, and it did a great job as you can see in the above video. Looks like Rashmika who is dumb enough to think that no one is supposed to imagine stuff above her expressed regret, and these stupid government officials sprung into action and arrested the poor guy who did this video. I wonder what part of the constitution says itâ€™s wrong to imagine and share oneâ€™s imagination with others?</p>

<p>I think India did threat social networking platforms not to allow deep fakes. What they did not say is how deep the neural network to be? I wonder if they really know whatâ€™s the meaning of deep fakes? Computers have gotten powerful enough to imagine stuff, today they are below human levels when it comes to imagining stuff, but very soon a Vijayakanth fan who is watching Gagnam Syle video can just talk to his T.V or phone and tell it to swap Psy with his favorite hero, and you will have Gagnam Style Vijaykanth video.</p>

<p>An Ajith fan who does not like Vijay will just say to his T.V to remove Vijay and put Ajith into it, and it will happen. Me watching Romi Rain in deep action will ask my T.V how Shakila or Rashmika Mandhana would be in that position and my T.V will create a new movie, it will one day happen in real time as well. Even I would star opposite to them ;) Why not?</p>

<p>Finding out how brain works, putting those findings into a computer, telling it to imagine stuff, then sharing that imagination is not crime. We are here to imagine, dream, and itâ€™s noway wrong if a machine helps us to imagine and create stuff better.</p>

<p>People in government think that we have copyrights here, but is it followed? Why not? Can they really prevent Indians from using Bitcoin? The government thinks putting laws will curb human desire to share and trade stuff will somehow change humans not be a human, they have totally misunderstood about humans. We are here to share, trade, help each other and become greater. I donâ€™t think these illegal and scary laws and action will stop us being a human.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-a-pinnacle-of-stupidity">Why not a pinnacle of stupidity?</h2>

<p>In case if one is wondering why I donâ€™t consider these acts by India as not a pinnacle of stupidity, here is the answer. Modi is one of the dumbest leaders India could ever have, I am expecting more super idiotic stuff from him. So this is definitely not a pinnacle of his stupidly, I am expecting more from him.</p>
