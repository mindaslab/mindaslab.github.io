    <p>Here I am recording one of the least traumatic experience with Tata Motors. A month or two back, when water was poured into the car for wiper, it just drained out. I was not sure what happened and almost at the same time a person called Viji from FPL Tata Motors called. I booked an appointment and went to their Guindy service centre.</p>

<p>Once I told the problem, a person sat us down and prepared a huge list of things that needs to be done with my car. I said â€˜noâ€™, all I wanted was this leaking problem to be fixed. That guy felt dismayed, but agreed he will fix it. I booked a cab and came home.</p>

<p>I think on the next day I got a call that the wiper tank had broken, and it needs 3 days to replace as they have no spare parts. I told them that I need the car as I have work, I went to FPL using call taxi, and took posession of my car. When I saw my car I was dismayed, it was covered in dust, nose to boot, and the person responsible seems to show no sign of shame. There were so many mosquitoes in my car. Even at that time I asked, will you call me when you get the wiper water tank, that person said â€˜sureâ€™.</p>

<p>Now itâ€™s a moth or two now, I donâ€™t remember exactly when, now the Viji of FPL Tata Motors who has amnesia calls me again, and asked if I need my car to be serviced (I should not blame here, she could be just a pawn in the chess game of Tata Motors to squeeze out money from our pockets for their cheap quality of service). I said â€˜noâ€™. She asked me why, I said to here Tata Motors is like a buffalo, it stands at the middle of the road, if you honk it will move, and the same buffalo will stand again the next day at the middle of the road. There is no use one complaining, or there is no use in Tata Motors service people acting as though they care about their customers. The buffalo on the next day will be at the middle of the road.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all the service centres in Tata Motors are buffalos, and you can do nothing about it.</p>
