    <p>Rich Hickey was absolutely right about sprints in software. Watch the video <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/liUiRfN9NzQ?si=6tJW0tkwWIt5yQeR">here</a>. But for some reason, managers in the I.T industry have always relentlessly pushed productivity via more work, and consistent work, thus proving that they are ultra stupid. It happens in all the companies where I have worked.</p>

<p>Next there are these productivity books like Atomic Habit, Mindset, and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. All of them try to convert a human into  a machine. Are we machines? No. For some reason, the coaches, and authors fail to recognize that they are writing books for humans.</p>

<p>A machine that works 16 hours a day might be twice as productive as the one that works 8 hours a day, but humans are biological and emotional systems, and humans are not linear. A human needs rest, a human needs thought, reflection, we are emotional beings, we are a complex cocktail of chemicals.</p>

<p>We humans think, we see our boss, and we canâ€™t bear to see someone above us, our juniors canâ€™t bear to see us commanding them. They want to be us, we all want to be the richest man ever. Itâ€™s a very natural feeling, itâ€™s part of being human.</p>

<p>Humans canâ€™t win over their desire, I donâ€™t think any conscious lifeform can win over desire. I think the best system for progress is the one that forgets about productivity, realizes that feeling of success is a myth, though one seeks for power, forget about getting power, forget about control, and itâ€™s better to go with the flow by trying to be valuable to the people around you, try to enhance their life. I donâ€™t mean to say that if you are among stupid people, you must be a stupid and hence increase your perceived value, I mean be of real value by hugging facts.</p>

<p>One way not to treat people as machines, is to be happy with what you have. Do you really need that luxury boat? Do you really need to send your kid to school that charges so much? Do you really require those expensive foods? That remote and exotic holiday? Or do you want to empower people who work under you and see what happens?</p>

<p>By letting the flow happen, rather than using force, if you become the next Alexander, good, or if you accomplish nothing, then still good too. Try to lower your desire, so that you donâ€™t force something upon people, let things flow.</p>

<p>By letting the flow, you donâ€™t try to be productive, but you try to be comfortable and happy. You donâ€™t create sorrow in many hearts. This is the way to manage people, I feel.</p>

<p>Today mostly oneâ€™s basic needs are met, one works for his emotional needs, you can get almost nothing by forcing that person. Else, you must find a starving beggar to staff your company, so that his or her poverty will make him / her do anything for you.</p>

<p>For your personal benefit, never go against the flow, do passionate things, this doesnâ€™t mean you have to impose your passion on others. This style of non-management I think will create a super successful company.</p>
