    <p>I take classes for Web development with Ruby on Rails, Data Science with Python, I have also started teaching Clojure. These are 1 to 1 classes via Jitsi. The courses are 3 - 4 months long and cost â‚¹1,50,000/-. If people ask for a discount, I tell them to pay after the course. Some people are okay to pay after the course.

Here comes the catch, most people I meet who want to gain this knowledge do not have computer. Somehow they have finished engineering without a machine, and they seem to have no idea to buy it. When I pressed many and asked how can they learn without a computer? The answer I got was they couldnâ€™t afford it. It shocked me.</p>

<p>I think there are lot a of EMI plans on Amazon and other platforms, but people are unable to afford that too. They are so poor, with a degree, they kind of know what to learn to get a job, but they canâ€™t afford. India I find is a super poor nation contrary to what many people think. I completely understand why Jio is introducing a very basic phone in India targeting the super poor, because they simply canâ€™t afford, and Ambani has the stats.</p>

<p>So why India is called a rich nation? I think it goes like this, say there is a nation X with just one person (just for easy math sake), and the one earns $50 per day there, now in India population 1000X as that of a rich nation and every one earns $1 a day. So India still on total earns $1000 because of its huge population and Indian leaders get to boast that India is richer than X as X just earns $50 as a nation whereas India earns $1000. This is not a lie our politician says, India as a whole is richer, but Indians are poor, super, super poor. Our politicians want us to think we are rich though we are super poor. Itâ€™s a deception with math they want to do.</p>

<p>To even things out in India, I think we need a very good economic expert as our leader. One who does serve people and not the oligarchs and corrupt. The leader should be capable enough to kill corruption (almost an impossibility in India), and should be able to spread money to all its people, than just few who fund the electoral victors. The leader should b brave enough to speak truth, and really brave should (s)he be as I assume truthful ones will be assassinated or brought down quickly from power. That person should not be mute, and be a slave to a foreigner (say an Italian). That person must connect with the people of India, and not live in ivory tower and just make policies listening to the intellect.</p>

<p>In short India will be a super poor for a long time, may be forever.</p>
