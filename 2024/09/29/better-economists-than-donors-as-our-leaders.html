<p>Vijayakanth donated a lot, and wanted to be our CM. Now Vijay is following his path as sun has set down on his film career. Letâ€™s say that Vijay has 10,000 crores of wealth, even if he donates everything, do you think it will be enough to solve Tamilnaduâ€™s problems?</p>

<p>One might donate to get publicity, but in reality apart from it buying temporary loyalty from some, it does nothing more. Yes, some might think that person who donate are the saviours of Tamilnadu, but they are fools I say. They should do the maths and will quickly realize donations does not do a dent.</p>

<p>We need economists for our land, these are people who are trained in history of knowledge, they better know how to distribute wealth, and where to put it so that there is maximum yield. For example Manmohan Singh did liberalization, and I type this blog on a Mac (but donâ€™t buy Mac, I was a stupid and I bought it), if liberalization did not take place, may be the computers we have on this planet might be very crude. Indiaâ€™s electronics options would have been very limited, and the world wouldnâ€™t have had Indian minds to design a better product. Liberalization is good. Manmohan also secured a place for India in ITER. Imagine weâ€™re having super cheap fusion energy, say in 200 years from now. He did not build Ram temples, and do anna dhanam! He knew what to do.</p>

<p>Sadly he had an alliance with DMK, which is super corrupt, and it brought him down, of course the congress had and still has a very weak leadership, it was not based on merit, but based on bloodline, so he wasnâ€™t able to manurer as much as he liked. His period, under Narashima Rao and he as Prime Minister, is a golden period for Indian economics.</p>

<p>I want my fellow Tamils to wake up, search for  better minds who are highly qualified and educated. Vijay or Vijayakanths shadows wonâ€™t do, neither would DMK which has become a family affair, rather than choosing their leader based on oneâ€™s work, they use bloodline to choose it. We need someone like Manmohan, and someone may be more. Maybe what about Chidambaram, and congress rule in Tamilnadu? What about Pazha Karupaiyya? He is not an economist, but he can identify one, make him as finance minister of our state, and listen to that one, thus propelling our state possibly to $2 Trillion economy. I would also like to pitch in Palanivel Thiyagarajan, but he is a DMK loyalist. As I said, DMK has lost its soul, I donâ€™t think it has touch with the people, and itâ€™s an absolute waste when it comes to democracy.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s think and talk about it so that we increase the possibility of change.</p>
