<p>I studied in Panimalar Engineering College, Chennai. It’s a super waste college, I am an electronics engineer (on paper) and have soldered nothing. I saw the video above on the internet and my heart broke. A Chinese video it is, and it shows how one can solder. But here I am a electronic’s engineer, and cannot solder a thing. Shame.</p>

<p>Engineering in my state, Tamil Nadu is a bogus thing. The colleges that teach it does not understand that engineering is a technical thing and one needs hands on with it. Almost every thing I read was from books, and nothing was practical. I remember how few labs we had, we can’t stay late in labs, our access to it was controlled. We could enter college only by college bus and leave only by college bus, this severely restricted our movement.</p>

<p>Our college chairman became bald at a young age, and he had a very ugly wife, because of that he did not want any of us to have girlfriends, so boy and girls were forbidden to speak with each other. I know people in west would be laughing reading about this rule, I swear it’s true. I am not gay to be happy about it.</p>

<p>The theoretical examination conducted by our state government is bogus, you can pass it with ease. There are practical exams, but colleges bribe the external examiners that visit and makes students pass.</p>

<p>If you ask my friends, they will praise my college. Yes these types of colleges are okay for people who want a paper that says they are engineers, even though they are not, but for me, a person who truly wanted to become a engineer and build things it’s a loot of my money.</p>
