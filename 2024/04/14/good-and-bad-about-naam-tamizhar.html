<p>I feel <a href="/2010/01/31/dynamic-democracy.html">Dynamic Democracy</a> is the only way for a country to be democratic. Maybe it will never be achieved in India as we are extremely corrupt, and corruption triumphs here all the time.</p>

<p>This blog is about urging you to vote for Naam Tamizhar Katchi, I will lay down why I think you must vote for them, and why you should not vote for them. At the end you decide.</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>

<p>Now letâ€™s look at the good parts:</p>

<h3 id="clear-communication">Clear Communication</h3>

<div class="video">
    <figure>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JA3n5hg_q1Y?color=white&amp;theme=light" allowfullscreen="">
     </iframe>
     </figure>
     </div>

<p>Naam Tamizharâ€™s communication is clear. Clear communication is what made Anna win elections. Anna did not speak rubbish, he spoke about how the Sanskrit culture oppresses us, and how we must wake up. Look at the above video how Kaaliammal expresses her thought, itâ€™s very clear. Itâ€™s very clear to listen to Seeman too. He does not speak rubbish like the ABCD (ADMK, BJP, Congress, DMK).</p>

<h3 id="unwavering-support-for-eelam">Unwavering support for Eelam</h3>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Tamil_Eelam_Champion_Seeman_Speech_Outside_UN_headquarters_Geneva_002.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Like Vaiko, we see Seeman supporting Eelam and LTTE. Itâ€™s unwavering. I also like the Taliban, good or bad, they are unwavering. They said they will fight USA even if it takes 100 years, and they won. Usually unwavering people with clear goals win. Individuals might fall, eons might change, but unwavering thought and desire from a race of people always has a good chance that it will capture the crown one day.</p>

<p>Maybe Naam Tamizhar will win one day, may be Eelam could one day be real.</p>

<h3 id="may-be-non-dynastic">May be non-dynastic</h3>

<p>ABCD parties are dynastic. We can find many examples about it. Somehow children of politicians get insanely rich even though they claim India is a level playing field for all its citizens. Still I havenâ€™t seen anyone from Seemanâ€™s family coming into power in Name Tamizhar. Thatâ€™s good. But how long this goodness will last?  Do Naam Tamizharâ€™s cadres have the balls to stick to Tamilâ€™s cause and dissuade Seeman from making the party a family stuff? Or will they be cowards like DMK people who watched slaughter of LTTE just to get Kanimozhi out of 2G case? It needs to be seen. But till now itâ€™s non-dynastic.</p>

<h3 id="may-be-less-corrupt">May be less corrupt</h3>

<p>I donâ€™t think Naam Tamizhar will be uncorrupted all the time. Evil people should be in it, and they will grow in strength when the party comes to power, but I donâ€™t think they can loot like DMK and ADMK when they come to power. They will have two things working against their ambition to loot, the first being their lack of looting expertise, second the fear that if loot gets exposed, they will be wiped off by Tamil people, unless their strength is like DMK or ADMK.</p>

<h3 id="upholding-tamil-dignity">Upholding Tamil dignity</h3>

<p>What happened to all those LTTE and innocent Tamil lives lost in fight for Eelam? Why a server in a restaurant in Tamilnadiu speaks Hindi to us? Why are there so many Tamils unemployed while there are so many Noth Indians employed in Tamil Nadu? Why is Karnataka not giving us water, and why is Tamilnadu not boiling about it? Why is Srilankan navy killing our fishermen, and why we are unable to anything about it? Why Modi sucks Srilankan balls? Why are we acting like cowards?</p>

<p>These issues and questions cannot be answered by pan India party, or a party that serves few families. It can be answered by  a party that has dignity in it, and it should be brave too. I find right now Naam Tamizhar is the only party that ticks these checkboxes.</p>

<h3 id="water-issues">Water issues?</h3>

<p>The Congress and BJP in Karnataka donâ€™t want to share water with us, so does the Congress and BJP in Kerala. Isnâ€™t it a betrayal if a Tamil party allies with it. DMK has allied with congress. Isnâ€™t it a betrayal if someone who claims to be a politician, and who cares for Tamil people to be in BJP or Congress? Yet there are Tamils who betray us. There are people in BJP and Congress who blatantly lie to us saying that they care for the Tamils. There are regional parties who back them up and stab us on the back.</p>

<p>The Congress and DMK is responsible for the defeat of LTTE in Srilanka, else we Tamils would have had our own nation. The BJP and EPS are responsible for Tuthukudi Vedanta Steralite plant massacre. Yet, these parties survive in Tamilnadu.</p>

<p>Naam Tamizhar on the other hand has done no anti-Tamil politics. I think they genuinely want to get our fair share of water.</p>

<h3 id="never-ally-with-cowards-and-corrupt">Never ally with cowards and corrupt</h3>

<p>Naam Tamizhar is bold, till now they have never allied with cowards and corrupt parties, thatâ€™s a very good sign. But we must see when they come to power, loot, then if the raids happen, who knows what compromised they will make. But till now, theyâ€™re allying with none other than the Tamil cause is saluteable.</p>

<h3 id="volunteer-contribution">Volunteer contribution</h3>

<p>I heard from my friend that Naam Tamizharâ€™s lot of work is done by volunteers. Thatâ€™s good. Maybe they are not getting corporate backing, thus maybe they are not allying with the rich and becoming anti-people. But as Savukku Shankar sayâ€™s, we need to think why Seeman defends G-square? Why canâ€™t a mighty company defend itself and need a politician to defend it? Why is Seeman defending it rather than solving problems of commoners?</p>

<h3 id="the-lakshmi-scandal">The Lakshmi scandal</h3>

<p>Itâ€™s gossiped DMK sent two girls named Laksmi to defame Seeman, one of the girls seems to have published nude videoâ€™s of Seeman. Yet, Seeman has come out at the top. No matter what the girls did before cameraâ€™s, Seeman looked straight, and emerged out strong. Thatâ€™s great I think. This is a good test of his resolve and he passed.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>

<p>Now lets what could be the bad stuff in Naam Tamizhar.</p>

<h3 id="just-one-recognizable-star-leader">Just one recognizable star leader</h3>

<p>There seems to be one recognizable leader in Naam Tamizhar. If Seeman is dead tomorrow, looks like the party is gone. I donâ€™t think that will be the case for DMK if Stalin dies, wonâ€™t be the case of ADMK if EPS dies, or wonâ€™t be the case of BJP if Modi dies. They have all got array of leaders, but yes those array of leaders lick the sandals of the supreme leader.</p>

<p>In Naam Tamizhar too, looks like people lick the sandals of Seeman, there is no credible opposition or alternative view from the party. So, yes like every other party, looks like Naam Tamizhar is undemocratic.</p>

<h3 id="savukku-shankars-allegations">Savukku Shankarâ€™s allegations</h3>

<p>Take a look at the allegations that Savukku Shankar has laid again Naam Tamizhar and Seeman:</p>

<div class="video">

    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w2DNBj7abJo?color=white&amp;theme=light" allowfullscreen="">

<div class="video">
    <figure>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NzyYfMsqthw?color=white&amp;theme=light" allowfullscreen="">
     </iframe>
     </figure>
     </div>

<p>Looks like there is no counter for the party. Even if there is, it has not been spread properly.</p>

<h3 id="never-know-how-will-they-be-in-power">Never know how will they be in power</h3>

<p>We never know how they will be in power. We never thought a party headed by Gandhi will be corrupt, yet here is the congress. Furthermore, we never thought party started by Anna will be corrupt, and here there is DMK and ADMK. Power corrupts. Today Naam Tamizhaar reaches people, but there could be a time when they are dominated by the rich, just like the ABCD parties, and they donâ€™t care about the masses.</p>

<h3 id="no-white-paper-about-corrupt-people-in-their-party">No white paper about corrupt people in their party</h3>

<p>There is no white paper about the corrupt people in Naam Tamizharâ€™s party, by Naam Tamizhar itself, so, are they claiming their party consists exclusively of un-corrupt people? There is no external research on that too, these look a bit odd to me. We donâ€™t know what cases are pending against who?</p>

<h3 id="terror-supporting">Terror supporting</h3>

<p>There is no doubt that Naam Tamizhar  supports the terrorists, the LTTE. LTTE did use some very bad war techniques in wars against the Sinhala people. They killed Rajiv Gandhi, which is a needed stuff, but they had killed 40+ others along with him, which is unacceptable.</p>

<h3 id="seeman-might-be-a-liar">Seeman might be a liar</h3>

<p>The way Seeman describes his encounters with Prabhakaran is kind of off place I feel. May be he could be using LTTE, the Tamil cause as a ladder to go up, just like DMK used Tamil cause to come up, but then just like DMK, Seeman could kick it off when he becomes powerful. Who knows?</p>

<h2 id="will-i-vote-for-them">Will I vote for them?</h2>

<p>Yes definitely. I donâ€™t think they will be absolutely no evil in the party, but right  now they seem to be less evil among the top parties.</p>
