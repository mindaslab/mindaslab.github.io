<p>Its was in  a project named places.com, a real estate website, I was into a
company called Zanec, that company had never seen Ruby on Rails, I was the first
guy into that company who knew Ruby, some how even without knowing the
technology they were holding a project possibly for 3 months! Let me come to
the point, my job was to lead a project and since I am a Rails guy I need to
provide JSON end points for front end Angular application. When I started to
work, the front end guys got frustrated with me. I was able to give APIâ€™s really
fast and I was seen slacking off most of the time.</p>

<p>Being brought up in a culture where one is thought work is gain, they got hugely
frustrated seeing me get away with little work. They seem not to know that in Rails
automation is built into it. That makes me just a person who needs to flick a
switch to get it done. Claiming themselves as computer engineers, I failed to
see why they failed to see my automated advantage.</p>

<p>The next thing is happening in a company called Trumatics, where I am a partner.
We are trying to predict the sales of customer, and its just a regression problem
with little number of sample values. Though it looks complex, its just a line
of code in GNU Octave. Thats it. Fortunately Trumatics is built up of thinkers
who can listen, so things will go really smooth there :D</p>

<p>I see computers as my slave, I donâ€™t see a point in getting frustrated about it
and working long hours in front of it. People who work for long hours before
computers look like idiots to me.</p>

<p>Most computer or I.T people in India are like this: if asked to cut a tree, they
go on to cut it. They donâ€™t mind if they have an axe, they simply donâ€™t care if its
sharp, they just go about swinging the axe onto the trunk and they feel happy
about working a lot and feel they deserve pay for their stupidity.</p>

<p>Many computer graduates donâ€™t even have an axe, they just have a pen knife or
just their nails, and they work hard to fell a tree and go almost nowhere. I
concentrate on sharpening the axe and on my swing. I learn a lot, code a lot
in my mind before I physically code. I read a lot about software engineering, and
about how complex code must be structured so that it can be managed in a simple way,
I read a lot about how testing helps if you are coding deterministic programs.
Unfortunately as far as my knowledge goes, programs that change itself based on
data like A.I ones need different thought to test them. They can be tested any
way so TDD freaks need not panic :)</p>

<p>Its these sort of skills, puts me above others. Its strange to think many computer
people in India think themselves as programmers and not as mathematicians. They
seem not to know whats the difference between concurrency and congruency of a
Triangle. Its quiet pathetic. If you just know some loops, branching and think
you can survive in I.T industry, I wonder how?</p>

<p>Its not just workers who are stupids, the I.T middle management and upto the
companies CEOâ€™s are stupid. Most companies in India put MBAâ€™s and PMPâ€™s who have almost no
knowledge of math and logical reasoning in their heads, as heads of project thats
based on computers which is purely mathematical and science. Its possibly due to
these reasons, our companies are not good enough.</p>
