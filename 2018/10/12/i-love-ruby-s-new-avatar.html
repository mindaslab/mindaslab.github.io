<p>I can’t imagine that I have been writing this book for 10+ years. I Love Ruby is getting a new avatar, its been ported from <a href="https://mindaslab.github.io/I-Love-Ruby/">https://mindaslab.github.io/I-Love-Ruby/</a> to <a href="https://i-love-ruby.gitlab.io/">https://i-love-ruby.gitlab.io/</a>.</p>

<p>Some one long long ago told me about Asciidoctor, I did not consider it much then, then it became evident to me that people love to read from mobiles now than PDF, so I started to port this book. Though I am Data Scientist now, and am using Python for it, Ruby is my love and I can’t forget it. It was sad for me to hear Matz say that Ruby isn’t cool any more, I would rather say Ruby isn’t used in cool ways anymore. Its the greatest programming language I have seen, it suits to my personal needs than any other. I never thought I would see a language better than Perl.</p>

<p>The goal of this port, even though I don’t find much time, is quite ambitious. First more than 250 pages must be ported, its a lot of work. I was planning to write a book called Solid Ruby which would talk to people about design patterns in Ruby, I have decided to scrap it and bring it under I Love Ruby thus making my life far simpler. I also wish to throw in some sample ruby projects in this book, and I wish to put out video tutorials. Since this book uses Asciidoctor, I dream of producing good quality epub and pdf, well, its quiet out of my hands though as I am not a contributor but a mere spectator to Asciidoctor. I wish to receive lot of feedback’s, they are really important as they give motivation or a chance to improve my work.</p>

<p>As I port this book, I am re-reading it and finding many places to correct it, and they are been applied then and there. This book as always is a continually improving book, possibly bit more professional now that it was released 10 or 12 years ago. I also thank my company Trumatics for sponsoring it, well it was easy to get it as I am one of the partner :)</p>

<p>I will be reporting the progress now and then in a sporadic way. Thanks for reading and happy coding.</p>
