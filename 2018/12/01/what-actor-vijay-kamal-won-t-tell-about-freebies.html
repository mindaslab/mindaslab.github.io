<p>It was a great promo for this film Sarkar, the film team was able to dip into the anger of AIADMK people thus earning much needed publicity. AIADMK got angry because it teased freebie scheme that was brought in by Kamaraj, Strangthened by Karuna, MGR and continued by Jaya. Kamal even went as far as saying that people who get stuff for free are beggars.</p>

<p>Many Vijay fans too heard the message and supported Vijay by burning free stuff the government gave them, but here is the catch, they posted it on social networks that was a free service! Neither Vijay, Murugadoss or Kamal opposed it by saying people are taking freebies from tech giants and becoming slaves to them. That’s amazing!</p>

<p>Coming to free stuff given to Actors. The land for MGR film city was given by the people of Tamilnadu to these actors for free. Will Vijay, Murugadoss or Kamal are willing to make propaganda among film fraternity to return the land to the people? We promote a film and promote it in social network for free for them, in return these people won’t even give a rupee for a post. Are they ready to pay us for that?</p>

<p>There is this <em>Nadigar Sangam</em> that does help to actors who are not in good economic situation, will Kamal call them beggars? Why not? Are actors deserved to get freebies by law and only Tamil people are deserved to be called as beggars?</p>

<p>We must evaluate who are beggars and who are not. Kamal gets sunlight for free, he does not pay for rain water, he breathes this oxygen free, he paid nothing to come into existence. The earth supports plants for free, plants and animals produce food for us free, the Earth does not charge rent for our stay. In fact man created money so that one can claim to be superior to other, else everything we have is free, we have just created an illusion that everything costs.</p>

<p>You are reading this blog because I transmit my knowledge for free, some one hosts my blog for free, and some on e wrote the software tools to build this blog for free. Else information on your screen could cause dear and you will be reading say one highly expensive article a week and brag about the information wealth you obtained to the people known to you.</p>

<p>So realize that just because some one says something novel or new or out of ordinary, it does not mean that they care about you, all they want is to grab your attention and sell their movie to you and make you their propaganda tool.</p>
