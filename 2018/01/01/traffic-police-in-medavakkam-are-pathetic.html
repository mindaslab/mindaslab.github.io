    <p>I have to drive through Medavakkam every day, and for past two weeks or more the
traffic police in Medavakkam are doing a pathetic job. They simply are not
regulating traffic, but just letting users determine when they must drive through
a junction.</p>

<p>I thought the police were not present because they need to go and stand and
salute a politician who travels from point A to B in city. Politicians like
to be saluted by police a lot and one single politician here in Tamilnadu could
pull away 1000’s of police for such duty so that he feels powerful and great
about it.</p>

<p>One thing the politician says is he is threatened by anti nationals and
terrorist and his or her life is in danger, but the truth is terrorists and
Pakistanis won’t touch these people as ISI (Pak’s terror intelligence network)
knows that Indian politicians cause more damage to India than all terrorist in
this world combined. Terrorist have no way to escape law as they are uncorrupt
and admit to what they do and they don’t have any money to bribe officials
to get legal immunity.</p>

<p>Any way coming back to Medavakkam. I avoided bumping into vehicles and inched
my way and crossed the junction, and just after ten meter drive I saw a cop in
shade enjoying his days collecting bribes from motorist. What the hell?</p>

<p>Cop’s in Medavakkam junction collect bribes from all commercial vehicles. They
just corner these vehicles and expect bribes from any where from Rs 50/- to Rs
500/-, once bribed the vehicles are let go. They do the same with motorcyclist.</p>

<p>There seems to be no force that could stop them. Well collect bribes, India can
never be a uncorrupted nation. But once you collected bribe of Rs 1000/- at-least
divert traffic for an hour. Or pay some to divert traffic say Rs 150/- an hour
and you stay in  a shaded corner and collect bribes.</p>

<p>I wish these cops are punished, but which cop in Tamilnadu is been really
punished for looting people?</p>
