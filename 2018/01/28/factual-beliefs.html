    <p>India obtained its independence is a a fact, but is India independent? If you say
yes thats a belief. Right from the processor I use on the computer I type and
the processor you use on the phone or what ever devise you read this article is
un-Indian. Most of us in the tech and tech based industry, in fact any industry
that is based on computers, rely heavily on foreign help for money. If they
say no, we are simply dust and economy would collapse.</p>

<p>Why then we think we are independent? Why we think there is God, though none has
sensed it? If we say we had sensed it, why we take our children to doctor and
not to a temple when there is a fever?</p>

<p>Why we think these beliefs are fact? The reason is Human mind is flawed. For
example take my mind. Some of my muslim friends introduced me to Briyani, I
still love it, and they worship god, and I reject it. Why so? I should have
loved God too!</p>

<p>When some one does something good to you, dopamine level in your brain
increases, this is registered by your brain that that person is a good one and
not that  his thought and action at that time was good to you. You perceive
that person has done good to you.</p>

<p>The next time, that person might say something stupid, like God exists, but
since you have registered that person doing good to you, you natrually think
this too is good to you and you accept it without question as a fact. Though
this is a belief, since you trust that person, you consider this as a fact.</p>

<p>Any society, including rationalists, operate on factual beliefs. Its woven into
our brains. Even if you think you are out of this belief system, that thinking
could be a belief which you have not recognized.</p>

<p>Can one come out of this belief system? 100% no chance, but if you debate
intensely with other intelligent and within yourself (given that you are not
highly stupid), then you can to a certain degree.</p>

<p>One may ask why people fail to come out of these factual beliefs? Its simple,
we humans are social animals. We have survived because we relied on one another,
this bond is as strong as lunar cycles interfering in our sleep patterns,
possibly far far stronger than that. We trust others because we not only
benefited from others facts, but we got their trust by believing in their
beliefs. If we did not, that person would have thought we are stupid and would
mistrust us and we would loose socially. But there are few brave who stand for
facts. Its too be seen weather humanity is intelligent enough to believe them.
Historically they (the intelligent and humanity) have lost.</p>

<p>Another reason that one would not believe in facts is due to convenience. If
you are in India, its better to bribe an government official and get things
done and ruin your grand children’s future than you suffering a set back and
making your grand children’s future bright. People are not that intelligent
and shrewd enough to put right things to action.</p>

<p>Any way its great to be on Earth and study this humans and universe, wonder when
this belief would be broken.</p>
