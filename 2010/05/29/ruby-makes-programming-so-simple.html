    <p>At first I used Ruby to create a class ranking software for my mom. It was a console application that occupied 32 lines. I was baffled and couldnâ€™t believe I had done so much in 32 lines (which included two lines of comment). Next after repeated failures I learned Ruby on Rails. Few projects after I used Rails, I was confident that I am an amateur Rails programmer. my Rails skills are improving by the day.</p>

<p>I got a classic project in which I had to design a web crawler. I called upon one of my friends to do it, he agreed. This thing took place yesterday evening. Late night yesterday I sat along with myÂ  NetBeans and some rdoc. I typed the frame work of the crawler and itâ€™s almost done (the core part of it). I havenâ€™t even spent half an hour of code. All I did was to install hpricot gem and its 50% over. I donâ€™t deny that there will be hundreds of issues popping up when I have chats with domain experts, but thatâ€™s normal.</p>

<p>I just canâ€™t believe it. Programming has progressed to such an extent that even a 5th grade school kid can write almost any app. With the time savings I make on ruby I wish to study more about compiles, operating systems (the Linux kernel in particular), Android, and put more pages to my <a href="http://mindaslab.in/ilr" target="_self">Rub book</a>.</p>
