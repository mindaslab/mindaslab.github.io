    <p>In my former office my boss used to say that hi IBM think pad had worked where other laptops have failed. I once worked in aÂ  industrial automation company where my colleagues and my boss worked in harsh hot and humid industrial environments. When I thought that I must own a laptop, I got my self a Lenovo (the company that purchased IBM computers).</p>

<p>The laptop did work fine, after 2 years its battery went dead which was normal, now I use it without battery. One fine morning I noticed a mosquito flying near my laptop. An attempt to kill it made my finger dig into the key board which made two of its keys pop out. I was able to put one of the keys in, the other I found had a small part broken and hence I canâ€™t fix it to the laptop. Its a minor minor fault.</p>

<p>I went to Lenovo service center opposite to Velachery Vijayanagr bus stand. The man over there saw it and said Lenovo does not make single key spares, he told me to check it in electronic market Ritchie street. It was a great great let down. Everything in my Laptop was ok. It could last another 10 years easily, yet because Lenovo decided that it canâ€™t help me, I have almost no choice but to ditch it.</p>

<p>What to say about a company that does not support its own product that develops a minor mistake. I really doubt Lenovoâ€™s motive. Does it want its customers a good experience? Or does it want to push electronic gadgets to people get the money and forget about them. Because of one key, just one key I canâ€™t type with my laptop properly, and its Lenovo and its attitude are to be blamed.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t know what Lenovo is going to do about it. I called ï»¿ ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿044-30616500 (lenovo office in Chennai) its phone was always engaged. I calledÂ  1800-425-2666Â  (Lenovo post sales contact) its voice message and menu selection never lets me in. I am been put into a viscious circle of selecting choices and never end up speaking to any one.</p>

<p>Looks like Lenovo intention is this, its wants to make money by pushing laptops to us and forget about it once and for all. If some thing goes wrong you suddenly realize you are in the middle of ocean and none is there for you. <strong>For heaven sake never ever buy Lenovo products.</strong></p>
