    <p>Almost every web designer, fortunately almost no web developer goes through this phase. A person who doesn’t know a thing about tech (possibly not even knowing a electrical system needs electricity to run it) approaches you and says he wants a website. With all love an affection to help a innocent fellow (or gal) you sit for hours and hours and develop one. After many changes he flags green to host it and you host it.</p>

<p>Things go on, and he acts like a good customer until that one fine day arrives. On that day you get a call from him and he says his nephew knows web designing and asks you to transfer the domain to his control. You do transfer it, his nephew just seem to know HTML and not a bit more, he complaints to your client that the website is badly designed, this that (you know about those kindaf humans don’t you?), almost everyday morning you get a call from your client asking silly doubts, you answer it with a grunt on your face and knowing that its going to be quarter understood and will be passed on to his nephew.</p>

<p>Our client calls up his nephew and tells the quarter understood thing to him, his nephew understands a quarter of it, that is 1 of 16 what you have told to your client, finally all ends up in mess. There is a good chance that the domain never gets resurrected. So how should one deal with this.</p>

<p>If you are a web techie:<br />
1. Charge your client for phone support<br />
2. Stop support if you know that the person is a idiot</p>

<p>If you are the client:<br />
1. Kill your nephew before he kills your website<br />
2. If you want to transfer your website to another web tech office of your choice facilitate a meeting between the old and new web techies, this will ensure smooth migration</p>

<p>Once nephews have failed either the client comes back to you (in this case you are lucky and can charge more) or in shame and unable to face you goes to another we tech company.</p>

<p>People who wants a website must do some planning<br />
1. They must be sure that they REALLY REALLY REALLY need a website<br />
2. They must sit with a web tech firm and gets their doubts cleared (this takes lot of money)<br />
3. They must discuss domain ownership and payment issues<br />
4. To be safe, enter a legal agreement</p>

<p>Once done with these you know that your website is secure (well almost).</p>
