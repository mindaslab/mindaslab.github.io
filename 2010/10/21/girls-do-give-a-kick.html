    <p>I am fed-up about a certain things about humanity. Recently I wrote about a <a href="http://is.gd/fTYCA" target="_blank">book on Ruby programming language</a>. It has the following cover:<a href="https://karthikeyanblogs.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/ruby.png"><img data-attachment-id="440" data-permalink="https://karthikeyanblogs.wordpress.com/2010/10/21/girls-do-give-a-kick/ruby/" data-orig-file="https://karthikeyanblogs.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/ruby.png" data-orig-size="227,278" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Ruby" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karthikeyanblogs.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/ruby.png?w=227" data-large-file="https://karthikeyanblogs.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/ruby.png?w=227" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-440" title="Ruby" src="https://karthikeyanblogs.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/ruby.png?w=645" alt="" srcset="https://karthikeyanblogs.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/ruby.png 227w, https://karthikeyanblogs.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/ruby.png?w=122 122w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /></a>Now common people what’s wrong with that? Because of this some companies did not want to give an advertisement! I couldn’t believe it. All men like beautiful girls. How many of us haven’t popped out of our seats seeing Jeniffer Lopez in one of her hottest dance?</p>

<p>I really don’t know about other men. But beautiful women does give me kick. When ever I see beautiful girls I have done my exams exceedingly well, completed difficult projects and accomplished almost impossible assignments. The books cover fits in so well with the title ‘I Love Ruby’ and why on Earth should I change it? Plus if a programmer sees this good looking cover after getting scolded by a pig faced project manager, he might feel a little better.</p>

<p>How many of you would run behind a girl dressed up like this:<br />
<img class="aligncenter" title="Veil" src="https://i0.wp.com/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/02_1/veilREX0802_228x357.jpg" alt="" width="228" height="357" /></p>

<p>Possibly I must put the above image as cover and release it as ‘I Love Ruby for good guys who never wish to see a girl in lingerie and never would have a girl friend’. Crap people.</p>
