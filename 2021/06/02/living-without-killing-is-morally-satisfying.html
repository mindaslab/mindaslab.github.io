<p>Corona is causing problems to many, but for me till now it has been a blessing in disguise. One of the many things it has done to me is to make me work from home. It was the dream of many I.T professionals to work from anywhere because we knew it could be done. What the management guys can‚Äôt achieve was achieved by a virus without a brain. No wonder! No way a virus has less brains than management people.</p>

<p>This blog is not about that. It‚Äôs about living without eating non-vegetarian. I was an avid meat eater, I cannot live without meat. I eat any meat, my family is bit different. My family is an orthodox one, so they should buy meat from a trusted muslim, the animal should be sacrificed in halal way so that we do not bring in bad spirits into the house. Sea food is not considered muslim, so its okay to buy from any one, but now looking at fisher folks and how indisciplined they are with hygiene, its a no now, possibly till this pandemic ends. So after lockdown, when the shops were closed and meat was available only from apps, who knows how they were cut? There was no meat in my home. It is now totally vegetarian.</p>

<p>Though I loved meat very much, before eating it I would always imagine how the animal would have suffered while it was been cut alive. It‚Äôs a conscious life! How the fish would have gasped for breadth like a dying corona patient just because some human would be happy in the near future because of its death.</p>

<p>We humans don‚Äôt want to be killed, cut up, and chewed up by any other thing, but we do it shamelessly to other species. I think of all these things and eat meat. I even suspected if I was addicted to non-vegetarian, and especially biriyani.</p>

<p>Almost all religions born in India ban the killing of conscious life for ones pleasure. It‚Äôs a very unique Indian idea, seen almost no where in this world where we have realize our happiness should not be based on suffering of a conscious being. It‚Äôs a very very unique Indian thought. Being an Indian, I would say thinking about the animals suffering and sacrifice for me crossing my mind before I start to eat is a no-brainer.</p>

<p>Coming to my addiction, I really suspected that I was addicted to non-vegetarian food, but after the meat ban in my home, I am now living as vegetarian, and I am vindicated from having tho think ‚Äúam I addicted meat?‚Äù. May be I am not addicted to animal meat. Most importantly knowing that my life is not based upon suffering of conscious being is a refreshing and morally satisfying thought.</p>
