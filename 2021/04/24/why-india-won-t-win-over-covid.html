<p>Deaths are mounting in India and looks like there isnâ€™t enough place to cremate people. Yet this is just the start of Covid in India, more is yet to come. This might ravage us for for 3 to 10 years, who knows? May be a miracle could make it less.</p>

<p>People are speaking how the governments have mishandled the situation and so on. To me this battle had been lost long ago, and unfortunately we wonâ€™t win it, which means, all who will die of covid will die and the remaining will get natural immunity and might suffer some cost like reduced lifespan etc.</p>

<p>In this blog I will tell my opinion, why and how it happened.</p>

<h2 id="lost-a-long-time-ago">Lost a long time ago</h2>

<p><img src="http://germarrudolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/three_monkeys.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We had lost the battle with Covid long ago, even before the first Covid formed. I wonâ€™t forget, when I was working in a company, my car got repaired and a nice friend of mine offered lift. We talked about many things. Once he said that 80% of salary goes just to meet  health and education expense. When a true honest Muslim says such a thing, it hits you. A person well disciplined than me is struggling in life.</p>

<p>In India, you donâ€™t have the right to kill yourself. The country might kill you by sentencing you, but you do not own your life. In that case the country should guarantee the wellness and happiness of every citizen. Each citizen should be well educated, well fed, should have well health. But here I see a very good citizen complain about this nation. A sign that India has failed.</p>

<p>We have privatised and commercialised health and education. Meaning you have to have money to have these things. India and Indians have lost to Covid or what ever health pandemic that would hit them at that very time when they slowly accept privatisation of essential services.</p>

<p>We had lost the moment we stopped selecting good leaders to rule us.</p>

<p>People are still ignorant. Just a peek outside my window and I can see tens of people and only few of them wearing mask. Even those who wear mask, wear a cloth one which is not so effective and now even surgical masks which I use normally seems to have little effect. They are telling us to wear a thing called triple layered mask.</p>

<p>Many people are still ignorant, and looks like they might realize only if death happens nearby. For a non ignorant and well educated population one should have an excellent education system which India had lost long ago. So we cannot expect a learned populace.</p>

<h2 id="stupid-government">Stupid government</h2>

<p><img src="https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2018/6/13/w600X300/modichan.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>The BJP government is stupid (so is congress). We were failing in economy well before Covid, and Covid exploited our weaknesses well. The government does not know what its doing, it would say there is enough vaccine and the next day news would report that vaccine centres have run out of it. All BJP governments have been out of touch with common populace and this one wants to give press statements that would make stock markets go little higher.</p>

<p>In short this government which did say Covid will be won in 21 days has failed.</p>

<p>Like the people so are the rulers. How cam you expect an ill educated population to choose a non stupid leaders?</p>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2>

<p>Well, letâ€™s hope that our deaths will decrease human pressure and harm on this environment and reduce global warming. I donâ€™t think India will become an educated and aware nation any time soon.</p>
