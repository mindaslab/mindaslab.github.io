<p>The BJP does this and that, but whats happening to the economy? Its sliding. Whatâ€™s happening to the fuel prices? Its going high. Your saving looks like its dwindling. Businesses are closing down and top tycoons in India are coming out to speak against the government economic policies. Without strong economy a country is finished. I am quite sure Modi will loose all what Manmohan Singh has built up. When Modi one day goes, perhaps we will be beggars and can be happy that we were not ruled by a ruler controlled by Italy, but one controlled by the magical properties of cow dung and urine.</p>

<p>Okay the econ is down, to fix it you need to have brains, not swearing, not ability to burn your midnight oil, not ultra nationalism, you need to have brains without anger, and that one Modiâ€™s cabinet that doesnâ€™t have. I am not worried about Modi making us poor, whats the use of worrying after giving a garland to a monkey, its going to make a mess of it, according to the monkey it did the right thing. I am worried about India becoming just another Pakistan.</p>

<p>You see once Pakistani earned more than an Indian. If Indian earned Rs 100, a Pakistani earned Rs 165, but now look what has happened to their country. They have to beg for $ 6 billion, which is actually nothing, and they are not getting it. The reason is their stupidity, obsession with something other than the economy. They were corrupt, fortunately right now we feel BJP is less corrupt than the Pakiâ€™s. Either they are un-corrupt or are good at hiding corruption. The next big mistake they made is to let religious people take over their country. When that happened, passion started to take over and development got a back seat, and down went Pakistan. Who can save them now? Not their Allah!</p>

<p>Its Allah in Pakistan and its Ram in India. Thatâ€™s the only difference between Pakistan and Indian politics now. I do expect India to go down in economy quick and none should be able to do anything about it. Then what would happen? The people with relatively good economic minds, the Congress will come to power, improve economy and corruption, and then we can elect this religious fanatics once again to waste away our nation.</p>

<p>And life goes on. But will that happen?</p>

<p>You see when fanatics come to power, a nation goes a full transformation. When the liberal Shah was in power in Iran, a woman can wear a bikini in beach, what now? Think! Once upon a time in University of Peshawar students had bands, wore jeans, what happened now? Afghanistan was a thriving country, what happened after the Taliban rule?</p>

<p>Economic debacle is the first phase of transformation from civilized to religious rules. When economy goes down you canâ€™t purchase things, you may not have a job, if you do you will not be paid well. You wonâ€™t have a good purchasing power. Life becomes harder. When life becomes harder where will you go for help? God men. And think what the BJP and RSS consists of. They have fanatic God men who think its their right to control our lives. I am very confident we are going there, and possibly no force is going to stop them.</p>
