<meta name="description" content="Got a fucking call from Axis Bank Credit Card department. They said a credit card has been approved for me. I said I don&#39;t need a credit card, but they said its approved. Its like this,Â  I walk down a street, a waiter from the hotel runs to me and says &quot;sir your food is ready&quot;, I say &quot;I am not hungry&quot; for which the waiter replies &quot;no sir we know you have money in your pocket and we want to empty it&quot;. Sweet talk, girls voice, and blah blah have trapped many in this credit cards and have made them poppers. So to counter it, I said I am a real estate agent. Well, I really am. I offered him a deal, just like he told many advantages of credit card, I told many advantages of having a home. Then I cut him a deal, if he can buy home from me (that too 20% below market rate) , I will get a credit card from him. That annoying fucker declined. If I want food I can walk into a hotel and get it. Wonder when banks will really start serving people than making people borrowers and thus controlling their life&#39;s." />
