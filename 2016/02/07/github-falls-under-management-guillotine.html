<meta name="description" content="We all like Github. For long it has been good to us and never demanded any thing for free software projects.

In the name of taking world changing decisions they commit blunders, walk into traps. But they are good at communicating and finding scape goats to their problems. In fact they do no real work, they just assign work to other people, and when things goes wrongs, its the workers who had done the bad stuff. They are heartless and go by numbers, spreadsheet, and see how much money they can pull out from the money they put in. In other words they are brainless machines who don&#39;t have intelligence enough to walk out of the religious trap they have walked into. But unlike people of science, they don&#39;t care about others and are greedy, thus they have control of the world and finance. I can&#39;t imagine why the people of Github are dumb enough to let their organization to be controlled by people who think control of people is their duty or right. I feel very sad for the demise of happiness in Github." />
