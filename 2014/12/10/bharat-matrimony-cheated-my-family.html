<meta name="description" content="Well, the pressure for me to marry was on. No matter where ever I turned, every fucker asked me weather I was married or not. Living in fucking conservative India I had no choice but register a service, Bharat matrimony was my choice. I registered for it, and I cared not much. I did get some emails in which girls were there, I just browsed their profiles and thats it. Bharat matrimony guys were a pest. Every time a girl offered me a like or sent me a message they would bombard me with phone calls to pay. Their service was bad, I soon realized they are there just to make money than to connect people who would like to marry. I at a time got fed up with their calls and said that I don&#39;t like their service and instructed them to delete my account. But that did not happen. They kept bombarding my email with spam, when I opened a email, immediately I would get a call saying that I had to pay. I had to remind them once again how worst their service was. It became clear to them that they can&#39;t extract money from me for their worst service. But those guys are cunning. Today at home I got a shocker. They had called my home, they had lied to my mom that I am  using their site extensively and they need to be paid. My mom not having a single knowledge of Internet agreed. They came home, got money and whizzed away. Even though they knew categorically that I hated their pest and service. Now if you are one of those stinking fucking ass hole who bugged me to get married and caused this loss of Rs 3000/- from my family, are you ready to  pay it so tat to prove that you are not a fucking asshole?" />
