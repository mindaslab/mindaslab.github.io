  <li>The author, a female founder, advocates for a sustainable, human-centric approach to business growth, contrasting it with the prevailing “growth at all costs” mentality often seen in the startup world.</li>
  <li>She learned from a peer’s decision to give her team a week off after hitting revenue goals, prioritizing employee well-being over relentless growth, which resonated deeply and challenged traditional startup advice.</li>
  <li>The author aims to enjoy the process of building her company, Dreamday, leading in a way that feels right and creates a life she’s proud of, rather than sacrificing everything for a future exit.</li>
  <li>She notes that less than 1% of marketing and advertising agencies are female-founded, suggesting that female leadership brings a more thoughtful, human, and durable approach to growth, as exemplified by Dreamday and Quality Media.</li>
  <li>The author, along with her co-founders, decided to treat their agencies as a “lifestyle business” for now, focusing on enjoying the day-to-day operations, which ironically made decisions clearer and the business more solid.</li>
  <li>She emphasizes that calm is a leadership strategy, achieved through building a strong executive team, defining who they are not for, and embracing incremental, sustainable growth over a “rocket ship” mentality.</li>
  <li>The author concludes that saying no to misaligned opportunities, prioritizing efficiency and durability (a shift now also rewarded by investors), and practicing gratitude are crucial for building something that lasts and feels better, without sacrificing ambition.</li>
