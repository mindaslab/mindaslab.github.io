<p>Only the Congress party has made pure Tamil’s rule over Tamils for 5 years after independence. It made Kamaraj and Bhaktavachalam our CM’s. Of which Bhaktavachalam was pro Sanskrit and he wanted Tamils to learn Hindi. Current Dravidian parties only made Annadurai (a pure Tamil) to rule Tamil Nadu.</p>

<p>Karuna Nidi is of Telugu origin. So is his son Stalin and being brought up chief minister, Udya Nidi Stalin. MGR is a Malayali, and Jayalalith is of Karnataka origin. Tamil Nadu has always welcomed outsiders who has done good to us. For example, father of Tamil Nadu, Periyar, is actually of Telugu origin, and maybe his mother tongue is Telugu. We also celebrate G.U.Pope, John Pennycuick, and many other British who did good for Tamils.</p>

<p>All being said, Tamil Nadu having such a great and ancient history, which is only being uncovered now, it is the right for Tamil to rule over Tamils, which he we have been denied all these years. It can be safely said after the Chola and Pandya period, a Tamil has never almost ruled Tamil long enough. Even some of the Chola kings are not of Tamil origin.</p>

<p>If you see in this context what Seeman of  Naam Tamilar Katchi says is absolutely right. Tamil should rule over Tamil and we should experience what it is to be ruled by Tamil. This is not me endorsing Naam Tamilar Katchi. I think they will be as corrupt as DMK and ADMK if left long in power. But still at least they are making a Tamil rule over Tamil.</p>

<p>One thing that is highly favorable for Nam Tamilar Katchi is its leader, Seeman. He is not an idiot like Vijay or Udhaya Nidhi Stalin. Plus, Naam Tamilar hasn’t got experience in looting like DMK and ADMK have. So they might take time to loot Tamilnadu. This could potentially lower the rate of corruption in next five years, i they come to power. They not forming alliance with any other party is a huge moral plus according to me.</p>

<h2 id="historical-shame-on-tamils">Historical shame on Tamils</h2>

<p>It is a high shame that I am writing this blog in English, and you are also reading it in English. Most probably you are a Tamil, and I am a Tamil. This blog should be in Tamil. Tamil politics should be discussed in Tamil. But then look what our leaders have done? Of course English is necessary, but a foster mother can’t replace a real mother.</p>

<p>Look at the Chinese. Their tech is in Chinese. Their programming tools are in Chinese, I think. Because they’re doing everything with their mother tongue, they’re able to progress a lot. We need some leadership in Tamil Nadu Which reverses the much of English, and commences is the much of Tamil.</p>

<p>BJP wants to destroy Tamil and bring in Hindi and Sanskrit. DMK are not good either. They have become slaves to the West and to the Arabs. So I’m bat for Naam Tamilar, despite it having lot of flaws, which we should see being magnified after we vote them into power.</p>

<p>So let’s choose a party that has the guts, or which at least promises to reverse the historic shame which we have incurred, why we need to earn money using a foreign language than our own mother tongue? Think.</p>

<h2 id="where-tamil-should-march-ahead">Where Tamil should march ahead</h2>

<p>Being a technician, I do like to see technical education being conducted in Tamil rather than English. More than that, our legal system in High Court, English is the language of choice which is appalling. We are Tamils, and we need a political party that fights India so that Tamil can spoken Tamil in High Court. Else I don’t think there is no reason we should be part of India.</p>

<h2 id="dmks-false-promises-and-failures">DMK’s false promises and failures</h2>

<p>DMK is full of false promises. They promise thousand rupees for every woman in Tamil Nadu, and that promise was never kept up.</p>

<p>Udaya Nidhi Stalin repeatedly said he won’t come to power because he is just a part of DMK family, but he came to power. After coming to power, Udaya Nidhi said he will eliminate NEET, which is a bogus promise, and he can’t do that. Kanimozhi said DMK will eliminate liquor shops, but we see DMK is promoting them, and getting a lot of loot from it.</p>

<p>Both Stalin and Udaya Nidhi have no brains. It is a fact evident. They are just being kept afloat by brainy people around them. Stalin never contested an election to become the president of DMK. So his leadership of DMK itself is not valid. DMK has inducted the most corrupt people from ADMK and is looting Tamil Nadu via them.</p>

<p>So should DMK exist?</p>

<h2 id="seemans-lies">Seeman’s lies</h2>

<p>I’m not saying Seaman is a good guy either. What I’m saying is we do need Tamils to rule Tamils. We all know about Seaman’s lies. How he told lies about meeting Prabhakaran, and his experience in Tamil Eelam, which are all false.</p>

<p>Seeman portrays himself as a hero, but never has he faced real Singhala power and might, and never has he dared to face it. He never has dared to sacrifice his life for the Eelam Tamils. It is evident he is not really brave, but we can’t prove he is a corrupt person yet.</p>

<p>Compared to the lies told by DMK and ADMK, and BJP, the lies told by Seeman is far less and can be tolerated if one should be pragmatic.</p>

<h2 id="sex-scandals">Sex Scandals</h2>

<p>Seeman has been involved in sex scandals, but I think it was DMK who readied the girls and made them speak in media against Seeman. Of course I don’t have any evidence, but that’s what I think and that’s what I feel. So I don’t feel anything against Seeman on this regard.</p>

<h2 id="alliance-with-dmk">Alliance with DMK</h2>

<p>What’s worrying most is Seaman’s meeting Stalin. How can a person who says who will reform Tamil Nadu, make it less corrupt, meet one of the leader of the most corrupt party ever in India? Only nowBJP has surpassed DMK when it comes to looting the nation.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>EPS is a cold blooded murderer. We have seen what he has done in Kodanaadu and in Thutukudi, So he’s ruled out. Since DMK is in power, I have listed the negatives of it, so no way I am going to vote for DMK. Vijay is a fool, and all his followers are also fools. Bringing him to power is like a death sentence to Tamil Nadu. BJP openly wanted to destroy us and want to enslave us with Hindi and Sanskrit. So no way I’m going to go for BJP.</p>

<p>The only pragmatic solution left is Seeman. I’m not saying make Seeman as CM but let’s make his party have more vote share. Let other parties tremble on seeing him. I wish <a href="/2010/01/31/dynamic-democracy.html">dynamic democracy</a> was in force in India, so that politicians tremble seeing the populace. Since it will cure corruption, no politician will want to see dynamic democracy in action.</p>

<p>I also urge readers to do research about candidates in their constituency. Sought out the least corrupt candidates or possibly zero corrupt candidates and vote for them. Even if they get one vote it’s going to be very good for them. Let’s take some action and let’s slightly corrode corruption. Jai Hind.</p>
