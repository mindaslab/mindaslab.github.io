<p>At one of the companies where I worked, they didn’t know how to do web applications properly. We used this excellent technology called Ruby on Rails, but for the front end they opted to go with React. That itself was very clear proof that they didn’t know what they were doing.</p>

<p>I was hired as a Ruby on Rails developer, and we Ruby on Rails developers hate JavaScript. They did ask me whether I knew the basics of React, and I just said yes. I thought the main React guy would handle most of it, and if he wasn’t there maybe I’d need to do a little touch-up. But then, to my horror, they made me learn the entire React.js framework. It was hell.</p>

<p>It was hard, really, really hard. For a person who is mentally tuned to the philosophy of Rails and Ruby, mastering JavaScript and React is really hard. So what to do and how to learn? Plus, I also needed to complete tickets and all those things. For some reason, I had a feeling my boss didn’t believe me. I don’t know why, but he behaved very oddly toward me. He was a good man, but all of a sudden I would get pulled up for nothing. So in that kind of environment, I needed to learn something I hated the most. I needed to do something so I could learn React.js fast and prove myself to my boss.</p>

<p>Just as I’m a backend developer who hates to indulge in frontend, I realized that a frontend developer would hate to indulge in backend. So I thought if I needed to learn a frontend framework with full concentration, I’d better write a backend framework that programs itself automatically from the JSON requests a frontend sends to it. This way I wouldn’t be writing a backend to learn frontend, and I’d be freeing up my mental space to learn frontend.</p>

<p>So I wrote a software called <a href="https://injee.codeberg.page/">injee</a>. injee stands for “in-memory JSON store.” Think of it like this: you’re a frontend developer and you want to do a POC—you just start building your UI, and the backend gets built automatically. Sounds magical? Some people have asked whether I used AI, but no, I haven’t. injee is pure software that runs on algorithms; it just looks at your queries and builds the backend. That’s how it works.</p>

<p>I built injee and it helped me very much to learn React.js. I made injee free software so that other people could benefit. But then the unthinkable happened: the company I was working so hard for fired me out of the blue, for no reason. They gave no explanation. And so injee was left dangling because I don’t think I’ll touch that nasty React.js again. It’s one of the worst frameworks I’ve ever seen. So now I need to find a new way to keep injee alive.</p>

<p>Because of these developments, I’m looking for interns for injee, and people have applied—so far all Indians. One thing I’ve noticed is they’re asking whether this project is under a registered company or something like that. This isn’t even a company; it’s just a free software project looking for volunteers. It looks like the students just want to get an internship certificate and do some paperwork with it. Maybe the government is forcing them to do that. I did see a government law that requires engineering graduates coming out of college to have an internship. I think it’s mandatory now.</p>

<p>When I was studying engineering, no one sought out internships because they weren’t needed. But due to this law, students are seeking internships, which is good. However, students seem to be forgetting that internships are for gaining experience and knowledge. They seem to concentrate only on the paperwork—getting an internship certificate. Because injee isn’t a company, but just code that works very well and intelligently with frontend API requests, I think I can’t attract interns for this project. So that’s the situation I’m in: it’s like India’s corrupt system, where only paperwork and formality matter, and the real learning or the real essence of why you’re doing something never matters.</p>

<p>But yeah, on a positive note, if you’re a student, or if you know some students, or if you’ve finished college and are looking for an internship that will help you really learn, and you’re okay with doing an unpaid one but want to get great visibility and work on an excellent library I wrote, I would be very welcoming.</p>

<p>I will teach you how to do frontend development and backend development. You can also learn the excellent programming language called Clojure (if you’re interested), with which you can code for the injee backend. We have very bright ideas to make injee shine. So if you want to do an internship and want real learning rather than paperwork, please contact me.</p>
