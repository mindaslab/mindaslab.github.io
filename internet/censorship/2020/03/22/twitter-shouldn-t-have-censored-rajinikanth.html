<p>Recently I don’t watch news much. I am becoming like an hermit, concentrating on my job, concentrating on people I manage, trying to bring them up to my level and perhaps if I am good enough they will become far better than me. My knowledge of Corona and other stuff is very limited, but I just saw a news that disturbed me.</p>

<p>For this self containment in India that’s going on, Rajinikankanth gave a explanation on Twitter on how he supported it, and why this containment was necessary, it seems to have contained many mistakes and Twitter has taken down his video. That’s disturbing.</p>

<p><strong>Twitter represents free speech</strong></p>

<p>The first reason why I feel disturbing about Twitter censorship is because Twitter was found on the basis of freedom information sharing, whether the information was right or wrong, you must be able to share it.</p>

<p>Many Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Jediist’s on Twitter talk about their religion as truth. Many politicians speak on Twitter that that they are here for their nation, and they loot, yet they have not been censored. Advertisements put out by companies lie, they are not censored. Companies and corporation tell that they support environment, worker’s right, but they pollute, and fire people when they sense slightest financial stress and they are not censored. The reality is those all are bullshit too and they are not banned. Why Rajini’s?</p>

<p>I am stunned how biased the world is. If a parent tells to a child, or minister tells to his mass in Church or on social media that God is there, its wrong and misinformation, but the world bears it because of ignorance and we rationalist bear it because we respect ones free speech.</p>

<p>I feel Twitter must support free speech, be it a Pakistani terrorist who says he want’s to destroy India because God told him to do so,  Twitter must allow it. As a human, it’s his right to speak.</p>

<p><strong>Debate</strong></p>

<p>Posting something one feels on social media is not wrong I feel, because one can debate about it. With debate there is a good chance of truth coming out.</p>

<p>We all know that Nithyanandha is utter nonsense, but we enjoy his comedy. We enjoy Modi, Tamilisai (though she has become a governor and is entertaining us no more, that’s sad!), H.Raja etc. We know that Rajini is ill educated and speaks nonsense, so let’s enjoy and ridicule it. Why Twitter is taking away that pleasure from us?</p>

<p><strong>Twitter could die</strong></p>

<p>Banning or putting a hold on debating culture and trying to curb free speech and misinformation is bad for Twitter. There are platforms like Diaspora, Mastadon, ZeroNet. Many who truly respect freedom of speech are using these platforms. If time is right, it might just take weeks or months for people to switch to other platforms en-mass.</p>
