<p>Few days ago I read in an article that FDA had approved lab grown meat for human consumption. Soon Americans will be able to eat their food without killing animals. This will start small, but will become the primary source of very cheap non-vegetarian food soon.</p>

<p>Say you want to at goats liver, say thatâ€™s the part that is in demand in your region, for that you must raise an entire goat, to access the liver you must kill it. In western world animals are killed by carbon dioxide poisoning, so they feel like they go to sleep, and they die slowly without them knowing it, but here in India we still kill animals by cutting them up, it causes pain. We as a conscious living thing want to live, but we do evil to animals even though as a human we know they experience pain when they are culled. So ethically we must not kill, but we do it, but today science has given us tool to obtain meat without killing a thing, and we must make full use of it.</p>

<p>All religions that originated in India, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism, advocate not to kill animals, but for nutritional needs we kill them. Even Aryanism which first favored eating of animals like horse and cow, after entering India became a bunch of cults called Hinduism today. Most branch of Hinduism today advocates not to eat meat. Somehow this land passivized avid non-vegetarians.</p>

<p>Unlike Arabia and Europe, where agriculture is not as easy, Indians had mastered taming of water long ago, and we produced surplus of grain, so we were able to be empathetic towards animals and get away by drinking milk. Religions evolved here have always advocated being kind to animals and to see them as our own. Even today in many householdâ€™s rice flour is used for kolams, so that ants could feed off it and be not hungry. So our land due to is nature advocates not to kill animals and be kind to them.</p>

<p>There is an environmental benefit too, say just to get say kidney of goat, you must raise the entire goat by using current practices, this requires lot of energy and time, with selective cloning, we can just grow the kidney of goat in vats with far less energy and time involved. Meat industry is one of the worst polluters and emits a lot of carbon dioxide and methane, this new technique of growing animal parts in vats will make it supremely efficient thus reducing global warming.</p>

<p>Meat that does not grow in animals which gets disease, emotional, tired, and that can grow faster in vats and in much more energy efficient way will cost less. Indians need to eat a lot of meat, we are under nourished, and we have a lot of carbs. An average Indian eats 2.2Kg of meat a year, an average American eats 140Kg of meat a year. An average Indian looks really frail compared to a guy from USA, we need to improve our nutrition. One way to do is to drastically reduce price of meat by artificially producing it.</p>

<p>Eating of insects too is far more efficient and more economical than eating meat. Itâ€™s naturally healthier, I with HRD ministry in India promotes insect diet too, but once again insects are conscious, have emotions, and may not want to die. But I do feel we must promote insect protein for healthier India. All over in eastern Asian countries people eat insects, why not us?</p>

<p>One might say that Muslim community in India might eat only slaughtered meat. Let them continue with slaughter, but 75% percent of India still can enjoy ethical lab grown meat and not have the guilt of enjoying food by causing death and pain. I donâ€™t think many Islamists in India follow strict Islam. I have seen none pray 5 times a day, my friends drink, some of them abroad eat bread (even bread in west contains lard), pork is a delicacy for them. People will change, imagine a guy watching his neighbors buy meat for â‚¹50/- and he need to shell out â‚¹400/-, definitely common sense will kick in. So I strongly feel India must promote lab grown ethical meat for all good it has in it.</p>
