<p>I was taking a walk today when I remembered this phone conversation in which a Coimbatore guy was saying something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúMy wife and her father had to take medicine to keep them mentally stable, this illness comes with high intelligence.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just then I was reminded how my life was tormented by people in Coimbatore belt. It was in a company called Z**ec where I was a project manager, another woman was also a project manager, she was from Coimbatore. She knew nothing about I.T and code, but lusted for power, she was like Nandhini in Ponniyin Selvan, I think life hurts her very much, possibly she did not like her marriage. She was highly sociable person, but she behaved like a psycho. I would give my team member a task, only to see that he had been seduced by her to complete her task. I was shocked and called her, and she threatened me to book me in harassing case. I was shocked a bit, but then I gained all my strength, told her to proceed, and I took it as my personal mission to work against her underground and looks like it paid off.</p>

<p>In that same company there was an old jalra guy to the management who was a true psychopath, who enjoyed putting grief into people, and he was this evil woman‚Äôs partner. This evil woman was from Coimbatore, I do suspect this evil guy was also from Coimbatore, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>In that same company I met a great guy, who workers praised as a great manager, we ended up forming our own company, but guess what, think about one year of operation that guys started to shout at people like a mad dog. He shouted at me too for no reason. None of us could get it, he was from Salem, not Coimbatore. I don‚Äôt know Tamilnadu map, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Salem was near to Coimbatore.</p>

<p>One of my girlfriend‚Äôs was near Coimbatore, and she behaved like she loved me and denied it, I wish she is happy now, but her dad‚Äôs sister was mentally unstable and did commit suicide. She herself did want to commit suicide once, and I have to talk to her for days to bring her out of it. I am happy I did not end up marrying her.</p>

<p>As though I had committed a lot of sin, this second Coimbatore girlfriend loved me and wanted to marry me, but she was too afraid of her family and family pride, she got married to a guy which her family chose, later I heard that she believed if my love was true, she expected me to enter tha marriage hall, stopped that marriage and rescue her, since it did not happen she concluded our love was false ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶</p>

<p>Any way at least someone thought I was like this:</p>

<div class="video">
    <figure>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ex36LeMLqas?color=white&amp;theme=light" allowfullscreen="">
     </iframe>
     </figure>
     </div>

<p>But ya, one has to be psychopath equating a tech guy with a rowdy. May be only Coimbatore girls can do that.</p>

<p>A Coimbatore person known to me bought a home in Bangalore, he was close to me and asked me to visit for the house-warming, I refused because in those days getting a railway ticket was not easy, I am unsure what‚Äôs the status these days, I hated bus travel as I got almost no sleep in buses, and Aircraft when booked at last minute will be expensive. Even though I considered him as my brother, he seems to have taken my ‚ÄòNo‚Äô as something big. He knew a senior Coimbatore guy who could pressure me up, so the senior guy called me and told me to attend the function, I still said ‚ÄòNo‚Äô, how can a new call change this universe? The senior guy stated behaving like a mad baby and was behaving in an unbelievable way. That senior guys sister was a mad person, she too committed suicide. I thought this guys was mad and so did not take him seriously, but these people worked to dislodge something‚Äôs in my life &amp; economics which I will never forgive. I wish they rot in hell.</p>

<p>In my software teams, I do find Coimbatore people behaving erratic many times. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my bias, or it‚Äôs the truth. I do know that Coimbatore contains lot‚Äôs of CEO‚Äôs and business leaders. Studies have shown that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/08/the-science-behind-why-so-many-successful-millionaires-are-psychopaths-and-why-it-doesnt-have-to-be-a-bad-thing.html">high percentage of business leaders are psychopaths</a>.</p>

<p>In Tamilnadu we see that in Pollachi and Coimbatore, women are highly disregarded and disrespected. I think those are the rape capitals of our Tamilnadu if not India. Coimbatore is a place where BJP is strong and wins regularly. If you look at Tamilandu governor, H.Raja of BJP, Tamil Isai Sounderajan, Annamali, Modi, what names comes to your mind? Ho many internationally renowned intellectuals you have in Congress, how many are there in BJP?</p>

<p>Have you seen any sane leader ordering to shoot his own people? Or claiming he had no knowledge of massacare that happened in the land he rules, and only through news he knew it? We had a Chief minister from Edapaadi who did it, I think those who protested against Vedanta‚Äôs copper factory were shot. I think Edapaadi is in Pollachi belt. Once again I could be wrong, but I do consider EPS a mild psycho. He might not be as corrupt as the Karunanidhi family, but he might be a psychopath.</p>

<p>I would be very interested if any reader of this blog can come up with data, proving or disproving my hypothesis. I am really lazy to dig in and find out which kind of people are admitted in Mental hospitals and from which region they are from.</p>

<p>For some reason I find people of Madurai highly mentally stable, and they have ability to put long term plans. People who are born and brought up in Chennai are highly professionals. Once again I would like some on to prove it or disprove it with data. Till then this blog is just a rant. Maybe we might find the source of high psychopathic illness, and maybe we can do something to avoid and cure it, thus making Tamilnadu better.</p>
