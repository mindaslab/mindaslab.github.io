    <p>I had to install some software on my computer to start off some projects, and i was thinking of doing it today, telling it to the person who I had to report, possibly get code access today and start seeing what I will be encountering in near future.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs DMK rule now and there was a power cut that started at 9:30 AM, and it‚Äôs 12:30 PM and no sign of power returning yet. I have always regarded Jayalalitha as the worst leader India had ever produced, but she solved massive powercuts in Tamilnadu, when Stalin took rule there are powercuts once again. As I type this I could hear ‚Äúallah ho akbar‚Äù being sang in Mosque. A institution that cheats people saying that God exists has power, but me who work my ass off, bring foreign exchange to India, say with pride that I pay more tax this year than the last am experiencing powercut.</p>

<p>What the company I code for would think if I say I have pwercut? I don‚Äôt know. A boss could be one who could understand my problem, or he could be a psychopath like one of my previous boss . Even during height of covid, my previous boss wanted a full eight hour back up installed in my home despite old people old people living with me who could contract Corona from people who are installing the backup. I was happy that I ended the project with him.</p>

<p>I.T industry is like that, usually people who did not really code, or don‚Äôt want to code, lead people who could code. And due to their ignorance of coders problems they bring down the company. May be it‚Äôs complex, people who don‚Äôt code cannot understand the complexity we fae, and we who code cannot understand why they cannot understand us.</p>

<p>Usually everything that‚Äôs been done by an I.T developer is subjected to criticism, by his peers, by his boss, by client and so on. This industry has evolved in that way, I don‚Äôt think it can ever be changed.</p>

<p>Mismanagement is prevalent in I.T industry. We all know Alexander is a great war lord because he fought with his soldiers, but Czar Nicolas is not because he sat and slept on decorated furniture while his men died. None mourned the death of Czar. In I.T today it‚Äôs like that, we have got mere wasteful Cazar‚Äôs leading teams. Even if they happen to die today, none would mourn their demise.</p>

<p>Many people who I talk to want to come out and escape I.T, but for some reason we couldn‚Äôt. It seems to be a trap. We are seduced by money that comes when we type into our terminals from our couch and bed.</p>

<p>I.T people seem to be ignorant too. Tell an I.T guy to get a gas connection, to find a rental home, most of them will be at loss. Recently one of my friends purchased a home, he signed its documents without a proper lawyer consultation. I was baffled, but he is okay about it. It‚Äôs that much ignorant I.T people are.</p>

<p>If I talk to a Bengali or Keralite, they are full of knowledge, but these two states don‚Äôt lead in I.T any way. If I talk with a person in Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore, that too one who is in I.T, that person looks damn dumb, and it‚Äôs no wonder for me that I.T companies are run in very inefficient manner, people in it are very unhappy. I don‚Äôt see such unhappiness with a Bengali or a Keralite. Clearly we in i.T are stupid and missing something essential that a human must have. I don‚Äôt know what.</p>

<p>May be it could be the smiles of another human. I take Data Science classes, people taking it express a feeling of gratitude, and I really feel like continuing it. I write books about emerging tech, people who read it write to me something good about it, and I feel like doing it. In I.T industry that‚Äôs not the case.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="https://bafybeidlz2yqx2yabgvcz67o3mrnxnpvaoqqtrcxtzeto65xgt3dyjwxga.ipfs.dweb.link/Aloo Bonda_finalforweb1.jpg" alt="" /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Tea &amp; Bonda</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In I.T you do one thing, and there will be ten mistakes spotted just because someone wants to prove he knows something, most of the mistakes spotted will be stupid. If I open a tea bonda shop, may be one in 10 customer will complain, that is 100X improvement in satisfying human. May be that‚Äôs what I must do. All one needs is a gas connection, and not electricity to open a tea bonda shop. Tamilnadu under Stalin will not have have electricity, but it definely can supply commercial gas cylinders.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs this lack of humanness in I.T industry that‚Äôs killing it. To offset it, I.T companies hire bright minds with lot of salary to endure this shit. I think bright minds should find something better, rather than code for I.T. They must seek a place where humanness exists and boycott hell.</p>
