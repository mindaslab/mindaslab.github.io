    <p>I had to meet a friend in Velacherry, I went there it was on a Saturday. For me food is everything, so we need to have biriyani. We ventured into a place called Madras Bhai Biriyani. When we enetered the smell was good, and there was a muslim serving biriyani. When queried he said there was hydrabadi biriyani and vaniyambadi biriyani. I went for hydrabadi.</p>

<p>Thankfully this hydrabai was not like:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7Y80xABY9A0?clip=Ugkx3G-vKny6xFSxHEyK2n20U-6z9sx4Ut4l&amp;clipt=EJVZGPbsAQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Looks like hydrabadiâ€™s like to get the feel of 5-star hotels while eating biriyani. In 5-star hotel if you order coffee, you get milk, decoction, sugar, and you must mix them and make your own coffee. Similarly when you order hydrabadi biriyani, you will get rice, masala and meat pieces which you must mix. Itâ€™s a kind of way we Tamils hate. I was expecting biiyani to be like that, but it was given to me well mixed in Tamil way. I was thankful for that.</p>

<p>The taste was okay, the brinjal gravy was excellent, actually without the gravy of brinjal the biriyani was not so good. One thing that irked me was, when you pressed the chicken piece, something watery came out. I am not here to make judgement or demonize that place, but there was a heavy feeling after eating the biriyani, apart from that I did not face any health condition.</p>

<p>So my verdict on Madras Bhai Biriyani is: not so good. If you are using old Chicken, please donâ€™t do stuff like that. Itâ€™s bad.</p>

<h2 id="they-might-cheat">They might cheat</h2>

<p>My friend and his wife are vegetarians. This Madras Bhai Biriyani and other shops share the eating spot, so they ordered vegetable fried rice, the server brought them egg fried rice, when they spotted the egg which was obvious and all over the rice, that guy said it was paneer. What? Thatâ€™s a lie, lie lie liar.</p>

<p>So biriyani is not so good, neighboring shop cheats. Not a good place.</p>

<h2 id="butterscotch">Butterscotch?</h2>

<p>In that same place there was an ice cream shop, I ordered butterscotch, what I got was something like vanilla mixed with some stuff, and it was given in a waffle whose dimension was like a small tea cup, and for that they charged Rs 100/- . i couldnâ€™t believe it.</p>

<h2 id="final-word">Final word</h2>

<ul>
  <li>They might be using old products</li>
  <li>They are not accurate, do wrong things and tell lies so that it will be covered</li>
  <li>Their rates are high</li>
</ul>

<p>Should you go there?</p>
