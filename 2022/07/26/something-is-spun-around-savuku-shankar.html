<p>India is crippled by politicians, government servants inefficiency and corruption. We are so fed up with corruption that films like Indian, Anniyan, Ramana are superhero movies who fight and kill corrupt people. They were mega hits. In real life we knew if such a hero would exist, he won’t last long. There won’t be public support for him as there is public support for hero’s in movies, and bad people will get him killed, or at least crippled.</p>

<p>Julian Assange exposed important facts about US military, he exposed how they killed the innocent. We all can see what happened to him. They booked that he raped women first, then I am not sure for what he is arrested for now, but we all know he is going to die in jail a very painful death. Almost none who shouted that one should have freedom of expression, not even US government which claims to spread democracy around the world would defend his freedom of sharing information.</p>

<p>In India Savuku Shankar, a desh bakth, is doing the same. Sharing information what he has, and his opinions about his thought. In a democracy it should be allowed. But looks like he has shared his thoughts about a powerful religious leader who has direct connection to Modi and other higher ups. He is also sharing thoughts about evils of Hinduism, and it’s caste system. He is against imposition of Sanskrit on Tamils. To make matters worst, he exposed corruption and durbar like practices in Tamilnadu police, and seems not be allied with any politician.</p>

<p>Now he shared a video where a journalist met a high police guy in a coffee shop. Let’s say I goto coffee shop, tape someone, and release it on the internet. A coffee shop is a public place, people who attend it should know it. The journalist has got offended and put a case against him. That journalist also seems to hold some kind of hate and grudge against Savuku.</p>

<p>There is also a right wing, pro-Hindu Tamil media channel (that will never face the fate of Karuppar Kuutam), that channel seems to be getting very desperate on Savukku’s activities and slinging mud on him.</p>

<p>There was also some order copy of court I saw which included tweets what Savukku shared. For some reason we call ourselves democracy, but if one shares cartoons on how bad India is, a so-called democratic India doesn’t seem to tolerate it. For example, long back cartoons against corruption was shut down? Why? I don’t know. Corruption in India however never seems to be shutdown.</p>

<p>I wish all the best for truth, and I hope it would triumph, but truth triumphing in India is very low.</p>
