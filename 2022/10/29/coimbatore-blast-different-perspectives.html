    <p>Few days ago there was a blast in Coimbatore. The case has been moved to NIA for investigation. In this journal I document what I think different people feel about this case.</p>

<h2 id="muslims">Muslims</h2>

<p>Muslimâ€™s are nervous. This is the second time that city is being attacked by Islamic terror. They do fear being demonized as there are lots of terror activities in the name of Islam in India. BJP is one step closer to demonizing them, just like Hitler demonized and exterminated Jews.</p>

<p>Muslims as people are harmless, but as far as I know, I think Quoran says that one day Rome and India will be ruled by Islam. So they are caught in trap. Islam doesnâ€™t allow Muslims to question it, at the same time they do not have the power to convert entire India to Islam right now.</p>

<h2 id="dmk">DMK</h2>

<p>The first Islamic attack on Coimbatore was by Ul Uma, when Karunanidhi was in power. I think DMK never got foothold of the city after that attack, now DMK seems to make inroads into Coimbatore and this happens.  DMK needs Muslim vote banks and is a coward party to take action against them.</p>

<p>DMK has always been soft on terror. Rajiv Gandhi was killed here in Tamil Nadu. A blast took place when L.K.Advani visited here. All wrong things happened in DMK rule.</p>

<p>Looking at DMKâ€™s move, I feel they gave the case to NIA because the state was coward to investigate and was afraid that it would offend Muslim vote bank. This is not how a leader or leadership behaves. Leader is a one that stands by truth all times. If NIA arrests Muslims, DMK could project is as an anti-Islamic move by the BJP.</p>

<h2 id="bjp">BJP</h2>

<p>I have no doubt that BJP is a Hindu terror group. They are destined to bring shame to all Hinduâ€™s around the world just like the Taliban and ISIS brought and are bringing shame to all Muslims on this planet.</p>

<p>For BJP this blast is a good inroad for their effort to demonize Muslims, to put a perspective that Tamil Nadu is an unsafe place to live, and they are right, it looks Tamil Nadu is unsafe. BJP are already behaving like they are the opposition party, and they might want to rake up anti-Muslim sentiment to gain inroads here.</p>

<h1 id="i">I</h1>

<p>Being a rationalist I am thrilled. I have always advocated religion or any strong sentiment is a drug, and it makes you do crazy things. For me all religions must eliminated. Religion has costed lot to India, it has broken our country into 3 parts already and is doing damage every day.</p>

<p>As a nationalist I am worried that ISIS is gaining foothold in Tamil Nadu, and all what DMK wantâ€™s to do is to loot for 5 years and go out of power, or bring Udhayanidhi to power if we are foolish enough. I also see that DMK is no longer a rationalist and atheistic party and has lost its meaning. All it wants to do is make few families rich.</p>

<p>I also see this attack on Tamil Nadu as a victory to Arabic nations. Stalin visited Arabia recently, are his Arab friends telling him to ignore terror activities in Tamil Nadu in return to make his family rich? I am not sure. Tamil Nadu is one of the farthest states from Arabia and Pakistan, and they are able to strike us here at their will and ease. India is a coward nation, unlike Israel, India would watch its people suffer under Pakistan and Arabs killing than take concrete action.</p>

<p>But I hope people will wake up to religious terrorism and will become Atheists, think rationally, and become peaceful while at the same time eliminating invaders.</p>
