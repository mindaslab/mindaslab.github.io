<p>I have always looked at Malayalam films with amazement. Why can‚Äôt we Tamils make films like them? Yes we did have this Jai Bhim which rocked the movie world and kicked off few Vanniyar Terrorists into action for their personal gains, that movie is just one in ten thousand, or perhaps one in a million. The movie that rocked terrorist before was Roja by Maniratnam, terrorist even threw bombs in his home proving his greatness. I also enjoyed Writer and Thaanakaaran recently to be fair with Tamil films.</p>

<p>But somehow Malyaalis are able to make films that are believable, relatable and with good stories which we Tamils are unable to do, and Teleugu people really really suck in making movies. I totally avoid Telugu movies.</p>

<p>I recently watched Oruthee, which was good, except but few dramatic scenes. It‚Äôs a good movie that shows how easily middle class people are exploited in this nation by rich, how the rich make their hard-earned incomes vanish knowing that middle class has no choice. I personally think middle class are the broiler chicken of Indian rich, we are allowed to breed so that we can offer services to the rich and their dynasties.</p>

<p>This movie also shows the foolishness of middle class people trusting the legal services offered by India, but this movie does not show if the legal service finally colludes with the rich and cheats them or does justice.</p>

<p>This movie too shows some police officers in Kerala are good people and do want to service the public. In Tamilnadu thats almost extinct! Here people simply do not trust the police. Due to incidents like Thutukudi Masacare; The case of Felix and Jayaraj; The case of Vignesh killing by the police, we in Tamilnadu call our police as Kollum Karangal (‡Æï‡Øä‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æï‡Æ∞‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Øç), which means killing hands.</p>

<p>Oruthee is a movie that all middle class people in India, perhaps the middle class of the world should see. It also shows the plight of Kerala, where people can‚Äôt find work and had to goto work for nations that support terror activities against us. In that way I am proud of Tamilnadu, despite dynastic politics, a foolish party that worshipped a queen, we are somehow able to provide better jobs though not the best. We Tamils are mostly slaves in our own land than being slaves in a foreign land.</p>

<p>This movie also shows the stupid state of Kearla, over there looks like police complaints should be registered in foreign English rather than their own mother tongue.</p>

<p>I also like the title, Oruthee (‡Æí‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø) means a single woman, or it can also be interpreted as a fire (‡Æí‡Æ∞‡ØÅ ‡Æ§‡ØÄ). It depends on the way women see themselves as. We all know how Kannagi saw herself.</p>
