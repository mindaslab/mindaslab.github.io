    <p>Everything was not okay in India. Fuel prices have crossed Rs 100, gas cylinder prices crossed Rs 1000 which is higher than some familyâ€™s monthly earnings, inflation is touching double digit and Modi was claiming <em>ache din</em> which means people are having a good day under his rule. There is an economic collapse in Srilanka, and people have woken up, in India people are still sleeping. This would give chill to any ruler.</p>

<p>If you take Romans, their problems were caused by the uncivilized barbarians raiding their territory. If you take Hitlerâ€™s Germany, itâ€™s the Jews who caused problems. If you take USA, their problems were caused by the Red Indians, then Blacks, The Soviets, now Mexicans and Chinese. If you take Srilanks, their problems are caused by Tamils. If you take India, they say our problems are caused by Muslim and Christians, and now all of a sudden by Tamils says Modi without mentioning us.</p>

<p>Throughout History a pattern emerges, if the people place a ruler who cannot rule, definitely the nation would sink, for the incapable ruler to be in power he would like to have a scape goat to blame, the usual template is for the incapable ruler to associate himself with the majority and blame the minority or an enemy state. If the populace is kept uneducated they will fall to such propaganda.</p>

<p>From the eyes of the Indian commoner life is becoming insanely tough, we have a clown ruling our nation who has no idea about economics and possibly wonâ€™t even listed to good economic advisors. So naturally the clown tells Amit Shah to say that Hindi should replace English in India as a ruling language, this they know would cause stir and would aid people forget the economic crisis. But for how long? In the long run it seems not to work, and never the center is able to answer the questions asked by people who are proud of their language and would resist Hindi imposition. So this could back fire. Some how the BJP has forgotten that Hindi imposition taken up by congress failed.</p>

<p>Amit Shan might have thought his words might fuel wide scale protest and some language speaking people could be announced as problem makers and Modiâ€™s India could have blame them and turn the majority against them thus proving BJP as the guardian of the majority. It seems not to work. We are too diplomatic in dealing with them.</p>

<p>Now for some reason they want to end it and Modi is claiming that some one is starting language wars, I think Modi is now thinking that people have forgotten that Amit Shah has started it recently. Well may be BJP supporters will forget, but what about people who have brains and think? Will they fall into this trap?</p>
