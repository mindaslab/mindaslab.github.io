<p>There is nothing new in this blog. DMK is known for it huge nation wide corruption, rowdy and murderous cadres, nepotism. One thing they stood by till the time Vajpyee became priminister was that they were bit anti religious, but were they?</p>

<p>DMK claims to be a non religious party and its UPA is non religious, but all these days they are in alliance with some muslim parties which even muslims donâ€™t think itâ€™s worth to exist. Many muslims either vote for DMK or ADMK, but DMK claims that they have non religious alliance having alliance with Islamic parties.</p>

<p>In Tamil they will say that <em>to hide a full pumpkin in a plate of rice</em>, by having alliance with religious party then telling they are non religious, is it believable? Any way as Tamils we all know DMK will do any thing to earn money and be in power.</p>

<p>BJP is a shame to this nation. When Babri Masjid was demolished, Vajpyee said that a symbol of shame had been destroyed. Well, letâ€™s say that ancient Islamic kings did demolish Tamples and built Mosques there, should we be intolerant to Muslims because of few scoundrels like them? May be they (kings of that time) did not have enough data, they were exposed only to Islam and might have been brought up been told that non Muslims are fit for nothing. Today we have science, we understand all humans are equal, and religion and ones spiritual belief is immaterial. In this age Vajpyee (who we considered an intellectual) saying such a thing is a shocker. I strongly feel existence of RSS and BJP is not needed.</p>

<p>Modi conducted Gujrath genocide killing lot of Muslims. He is a un-educated idiot filled with narcism, nothing can be done about it, we can hope that some miracle would happen and he would die, but he does keep his health top notch any way. Modi thinking wrong about minorities in India is one thing, but Vajpyee not forgiving mistakes done by the muslim invaders is worry-some. DMK having an alliance then with Vajpyee BJP was immoral and shame to Dravidian society as a whole. DMK is not a dravidian party.</p>

<p>Vajpyee led well, he did not pursue Hindutava because of aligning with DMK, but I felt a Dravidian party has fell down the ladder of morality by having alliance with a religious parties. Ideally DMK should not have alliance with any religious party if they utter the word of Periyaar and rationalism.</p>

<p>An ideal DMK member should educate people that God does not exists, and what exists is real. A DMK guy should make one think, ask questions like how likely that a party is worth existing if Grandpa, Dad, and Son are the leaders without much contest. They must think, question, be brave and rational.</p>

<p>In Edapaadiâ€™s rule when Modi visited Chennai, DMK was loved by Tamils as it took to the slogan <em>Go Back Modi</em>. But now? Just for itâ€™s survival, for power, for Udhayanidhi to be next CM, and for the center to turn blind eye to corruption in Tamilnadu, Modi is welcomed here. This is a blow to DMKâ€™s moral stand, and I donâ€™t think a party and / or a leader who would switch morals to stay in power is worthy of existence.</p>
