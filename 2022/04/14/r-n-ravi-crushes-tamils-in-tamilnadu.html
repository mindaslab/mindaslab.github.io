<p>Our politics is dominated by scoundrels, and R.N.Ravi is no different. Rather than respecting the constitution and being a governor who does his duties well, he is just obeying the BJP and delaying to sign laws passed by Tamilnadu government. The question is ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù.</p>

<p>During the second world war there was a massive famine in India. Winston Churchill had transported all Indian grains to England to feed their army and people. Millions of Indians died and Winston Churchill was awarded the Nobel Prize. So why the world turned a blind eye to massive deaths in India?</p>

<p>Today everyone empathizes with Ukrainians, thats great, but the world forgot about Tamil genocide in Srilanka, the world barely remembers genocide of Kurds by Turkey and genocide conducted by Bokoharam. Why?</p>

<p>A simple answer is they are not us. People empathize and want to uplift only people who they can associate with. It‚Äôs a natural phenomenon. That‚Äôs how human brans work. Those who cannot empathize with us should not be allowed to rule us. It‚Äôs that simple.</p>

<p>We Tamils should never let BJP conquer us. For more than 5000 years, the Hindus have made us worship Gods in their language Sanskrit. Said that Tamil is the language of people born to prostitutes and so on. Now we see one who holds such kind of values is our governor, and a party that holds such kind of value, the BJP, is ruling India.</p>

<p>BJP people are so blind that it‚Äôs said that it‚Äôs minister Nirmala Sitharaman when questioned about rising onion prices seems to have said that she is not bothered about it because she does not consume onions.</p>

<p>BJP wants us to blindly believe that they are the ones who should rule all over India. They want us to believe that they are divine, unquestionable, unappeasable, because they have got this divine power by drinking cow urine and eating cow shit every day!</p>

<p>In those states that are ruled by parties that don‚Äôt eat shit and drink urine,
BJP is irritating the government by telling the governor to be a impediment to the government appointed by the people. This is pure murder of democracy.</p>

<p>We Tamils should take a note of it, we must talk, blog, vlog about it, so that the world knows about Modi and his BJP. Many think he is great, but none knows how he is destroying us Tamils in Tamilnadu. Modi is not one of us, and BJP people smelling his farts and eating his shit is not one of us too. They are just Sanskrit speaking Winston Churchills. The world must know that Modi ruled India is not constitution respecting democracy.</p>
