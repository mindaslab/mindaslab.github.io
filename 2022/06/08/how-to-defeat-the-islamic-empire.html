<p>I am dead against BJP, their philosophy of intolerance. they must tolerate other religions than hinduism I feel, and they being the ruling party should defend the right of Indian to speak anything he wants rather than bowing to vote bank pressure and throwing out Nupur.</p>

<p>This girl having said something about Muhammad now is facing death threats from hardline Islamists. The funny thing is none really knows if prophet Muhammad existed. We today know God is not there and it‚Äôs impossible for him to have spoken to Muhammad or Munnusamy. May be if Muhammad existed it would have been an illusion, just like the ones Nithyanadha get‚Äôs these days.</p>

<p>These people may not even know they are fools, they think what they envision is true, and their belief makes us believe what they say. Unless scientific thinking pervades over all humanity, religion and people who are been cheated by it will exist. It‚Äôs very energy efficient for our brains to take in as truth what most say, rather than compute from basic facts and arrive to a conclusion whats is the truth.</p>

<p>Basically humans have scientific and logic thought. Though many believe God is there, and he is answering us and is almighty, none, not even the true believer says ‚ÄúGod I want a samosa to appear before me‚Äù, instead they goto a shop and buy it which is scientifically proven to work.</p>

<h2 id="india-is-not-arabia">India is Not Arabia</h2>

<p>I don‚Äôt know why the Arabs don‚Äôt want to question Islam and reform in big way. I am also very sure almost no Arab is a true Muslim and has reformed in some way. They must know India is not Arabia. Here we question Gods, comment about it, scold God in prayer, rate it, fall in love with it, marry it, give it name, give it form, make it multiply, transform and make it compete against itself. It‚Äôs my God here, not a God defined by some one in some book. The theological philosophy and thinking in India goes far beyond, may be to the days when Arabia was evergreen forrest. It‚Äôs far mature.</p>

<p>Here talking about God even in negative terms is not bad, though hardline Hindus are trying to turn India into an Arab like state where their notion of religion is right and others is wrong.</p>

<p>For example hardline Hindus have forced M.F.Husein out of this nation just because he drew Goddess Saraswati naked. It‚Äôs his version of her and he is entitled to have it. Once again none knows if a girl called Saraswati existed and she played veena, and did so much good to society that she was worshiped as God. She could just be an imagination form a persons brain who was smoking a pot at that time! Who knows?</p>

<p>Arabs should know that this is India where opinions are tolerated and not banished.</p>

<p>For example Arabs could not tolerate some one drawing prophet Muhammad, I don‚Äôt know why. When ever I imagine Muhmmad I see a man towing a camel with a beard, in white Arabic robe, I don‚Äôt see something like a light bulb or blof of light moving like an UFO around and saying Allah said this and that. That would scare people off. Even Europeans imagine Muhammad as a person and draw him.</p>

<p>They even have a day called Draw Muhammd day just to tell the Arabs that in Europe one has the right to imagine and visualize, and it‚Äôs not bad. For some reason which I cannot understand, Arabs do not like a visual representation of their own prophet.</p>

<p>Similarly Arabs must realize that India is much of a free nation than Arabia where people control what other should even think, eat, etc.</p>

<h2 id="quran-spells-trouble-to-india">Quran spells trouble to India</h2>

<p>Even though we don‚Äôt know if Muhammad exist or not, in Quran it‚Äôs said that Rome and India will be converted to Islam, and hard line Muslims still hold it true. They do all crazy things like sending terrorist from Pakistan, trying to take off Kashmir and Punjab away from India and all those nonsense. People never seem to realize that laws of Physics work, but human belief sometimes work and sometimes doesn‚Äôt.</p>

<h2 id="defeating-the-islamic-empire">Defeating the Islamic Empire</h2>

<p>Currently Saudi Arabia earns $1 billion a day, and part of it definitely used to create people to kill us. Like Gandhis Salt and Kadhi protest, if we change our consumer behavior we can mitigate some attacks on us.</p>

<h3 id="electric-vehicles">Electric Vehicles</h3>

<p>The money we spend for petroleum goes to Arabs, if you can switch your car or bike to electric, you are saving money in the long run, and coal power plants get coal mostly from Australia which won‚Äôt get mad if we talk something about Pope or Jesus or something, and Aussies won‚Äôt sponsor killing of Indians. That will put a dent in Arab revenue.</p>

<h3 id="solar-cell-roof-tops">Solar cell roof tops</h3>

<p>Get solar cell roof tops, it will charge your electric vehicle and make your commute cost almost to zero. If we can generate electricity from Kashmir to Kaniyakumari and share it on grid, we can even eliminate diesel and crude oil power plants that take our money to Arabia.</p>

<h3 id="solar-water-heaters--cooking">Solar water heaters / cooking</h3>

<p>If you can‚Äôt afford costly solar cell roof tops, try to go with solar water heater, try using solar cooker. If you can save LPG by cooking with preheated water, or if you can cook with solar power, we are denying that revenue to Arabia.</p>

<h3 id="dont-travel-in-qatar-airlines">Don‚Äôt travel in Qatar Airlines</h3>

<p>Qatar Airways though awesome feeds money to Arabia. Try not to travel in it. If you have planned tours in Islamic countries cancel it. This will put a dent in their revenue from us.</p>

<h3 id="stop-working-for-arab-nations">Stop working for Arab nations</h3>

<p>If you are planning for job in Arab nation, reconsider. Consider Europe, Australia, Canada or even USA. Personally I don‚Äôt like USA as all it‚Äôs been able to do is genocide, but at least in theory they support free speech.</p>

<p>If you are working in Arab nations, try switching job to some other nation. I am sure Arabs see us as slaves than workers.</p>

<p>This is the most important thing. We in Tamilnadu had Periyaar to educate us about truth. Europeans had James Randi, they have Richard Dawkins etc.</p>

<p>But for the Islamic world? Are voices been suppressed believing a baseless millennium old book? When will Muslims improve? Know the truth? Shed their religion and embrace rational thought?</p>

<p>Will the descendants of Muslims 100 years from now be a modern human, or some one who upholds cock and bull stories? We the rationalists must reach out. May be economically draining out Arabia is a temporary solution, but in long run we must empower them to embrace science and have a rational thought.</p>
