Passage of educational programs does not guarantee a job at Google, as the company said in a separate footnote.

Recommendations on the education Go through the introductory course of Computer Science: Udacity, Coursera. Learn how to program at least one OOP language: C ++, Java, Python: For beginners: Coursera - Programming training, MIT course on Java, Google course on Python , Coursera course on Python. For Intermediate level: Udacity - design of computer programs, Coursera - creation of high-quality code, Coursera - programming languages, Brown University Сourse - an introduction to programming. Expand your repertoire: JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Ruby, PHP, C, Perl, Shell. Lisp, Scheme: tutorial on HTML, codeacademy.com. Learn how to test code: Udacity - testing methods, Udacity - program debugging. Knowledge of discrete mathematics: mathematics course for programmers MIT. Understanding of algorithms and data structures: MIT introductory course about algorithms, Coursera - introductory course about algorithms (part 1 and part 2), the list of algorithms, the types of data structures, the book about algorithms. Understanding the work of operating systems: Berkeley course. Explore artificial intelligence: the entry into robotics, Stanford course, machine learning. Compiler creation: Coursera сourse.  Knowledge of cryptography: Coursera course about cryptography, Udacity course about cryptography.  Knowledge of parallel programming: Coursera course Recommendations on the work Create a site, construct your own server, or create a robot: a list of Apache projects, Google Summer of Code, a team of Google developers. Develop a small part of a large system, read and understand the code, learn the program documentation, debug your program. Supporting Resources: GitHub, Kiln. Work on the project in team. You will learn from others and learn teamwork. Upgrade your programming skills and knowledge of algorithms: CodeJam, ACM ICPC. Teach others. Become an intern: google.com/jobs.
