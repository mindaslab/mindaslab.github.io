<meta name="description" content="Had a conversation with an MBA guy today. I just wish I never had it, an hour long unnecessary biz talk that was worthless to me. If an MBA wants to come into a tech industry he must know tech, learn to code, learn to build circuits, know the difficulties in it. Else tech people with think him or her as stupid. Of course most don&#39;t tell it out, their salaries will disappear if they do. I wonder why this study called MBA exists? How come you can administer a carpenter shop if you do not know about wood working? I simply don&#39;t understand. Recently I found out MBA&#39;s don&#39;t even read about Psychology which is essential to managing people, and Strategy which is essential to running a business. That is stupid syllabus. I think all they know is money, money, money and some how I must become rich even if it happens to be being undignified. Like every society in which the intelligent is ignored until a crisis arises, intelligent people are ignored until a crisis arises in a company. When it does so the MBA withdraws, asks advice from the tech people and when the tech people toil and solve it, MBA&#39;s take away most of the wealth. I think we engineers must stop cooperating with MBA&#39;s, or if the cooperation is forced upon we must give wrong information to confuse them, and hop to companies that put tech first and avoids the MBA&#39;s. Successful companies are run by people who don&#39;t have the MBA minds but who understands every nut and bolt. They have created environments in which peopleÂ  are free and not bound by stupid rules. Looks like the art of management is to force an engineer build an iron bridge with wooden rivets and put the blame on him when it fails. And the art of engineer is not to become one of those MBA&#39;s." />

<p>Had a conversation with an MBA guy today. I just wish I never had it, an hour long unnecessary biz talk that was worthless to me. If an MBA wants to come into a tech industry he must know tech, learn to code, learn to build circuits, know the difficulties in it. Else tech people with think him or her as stupid. Of course most don't tell it out, their salaries will disappear if they do.</p>
<p>I wonder why this study called MBA exists? How come you can administer a carpenter shop if you do not know about wood working? I simply don't understand. Recently I found out MBA's don't even read about Psychology which is essential to managing people, and Strategy which is essential to running a business. That is stupid syllabus. I think all they know is money, money, money and some how I must become rich even if it happens to be being undignified.</p>
<p>Like every society in which the intelligent is ignored until a crisis arises, intelligent people are ignored until a crisis arises in a company. When it does so the MBA withdraws, asks advice from the tech people and when the tech people toil and solve it, MBA's take away most of the wealth.</p>
