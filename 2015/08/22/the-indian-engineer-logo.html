<meta name="description" content="Indians are contributing a lot to the world in terms of man power, and given the right opportunity, Indian Engineers are making a break through. I was watching a youtube video about German arms that were used in second world war 2. I was amazed by their organization capacity and their engineering. In fact Germany&#39;s industrial output peaked in 1944, just a year before it was defeated! I feel one day India too will become proud of her engineers. An eminent scientist Abdul Kalam who is the inspiration of many engineers in this nation, when he died recently, all th nation mourned. The techniques that he, Satish Dawan, Vickram Sarabhai, Sivathanu Pillai and many others invented and followed have created ISRO, one of the most efficient space organization, and Bhramos, the most fastest and lethal cruise missile. Human resource officers must play a crucial role in this nation, they must be good engineers themselves so that they can spot good engineers among the noise of those who claim to be engineers. A company that amasses good engineers, provides right and happy environment, and good opportunity for them will be respected and may eventually succeed. When recruiting, one must recruit a person who has clarity of thought and must also look for special Indian character, that is purity of soul. Now lets come to the logo What this logo represents? First this logo represents the tricolor. The tricolor has a significance. The saffron represents the great sacrifice our people have made to gain freedom. In similar fashion Indian engineers need to make great sacrifices. We are in  a backward nation in many ways, many nations like USA, China, and others envy our development, we are not as resourceful as them but we are much brainy and possibly hard working. We must make some sacrifices to beat them. For example no matter what, I did not settle abroad to contribute to brain drain, because I believe in this nation (except for one personal shattering moment when India forgot that I could speak freely). The logo also has white, that represents cleanliness and purity of mind, a much needed characteristic for an engineer. If ones character is good, ones compassion increases. One must not only be compassionate about business, but for our environment and living things. Humans are destroying the environment at  a large scale, its alarming, wen Indian Engineers design solution they must take into account it aids the environment and our fellow species as much as possible. The nature and enviornment are represented as green strip. There is a blue cog at the middle, in Indian flag it would be Ashoka Chakram. The cog or gear wheel was very important for industrial revolution, and was a great piece of engineering. The logo rises and falls a bit, showing this is how engineering experience will be. One will rise and fall, but then the logo rises rapidly after fall, which symbolizes as with experience and perfection sets, your ascent will be almost unstoppable. The cog too represents something, first your achievements are small, but then with that as a base, it would turn a bigger cog, or your achievements will get bigger and bigger. I hope most engineers are happy with this logo, and proudly display it if they are Indian an engineer, contributing to humanity any where in this universe. One is encouraged to make changes, you can get the logo here https://openclipart.org/detail/225583/indian-engineer" />
