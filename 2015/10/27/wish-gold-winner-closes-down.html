<meta name="description" content="A beautiful morning, and I was off to walk, only to be stopped by somewhat pungent smell of oil vapor polluting the atmosphere. Its this dreaded Gold Winner Oil Company thats located in Sithapakkam and pumping its pollutants into the air. I had to abort morning walk and return back to my room where the air quality was no different. Thanks to the penetrating nature of this pollution. This Gold Winner Oil Company that promotes good health for every one seems to have failed to notice that its operations are causing irritation, perhaps lack of health and breathing trouble to people located near its factories. This oil vapor that mixes with the air is thick, stays at the ground because its dense, does not get cleared up easily, and the factory emits the pollution at early mornings and school going hours. Many at time I had found my sleep getting disturbed by this pollutants creep into my window, thus disturbing my sleep. I am quiet sure the owner of Gold winner stays somewhere far far away where these pollutants cannot touch him. What about the children that breathe these pollutants and go to school everyday? What about their health? I wonder how people with breathing difficulties live in Sithalapakkam? One of the press reporters I knew once said that Gold Winner dumps pollutants and waste into Sithalapakkam lake. I wonder how true it is, but of course what happens to solid and liquid waste the Gold Winner generates? Where does it go? I wonder how and why the politicians of Sithalapakkam allowed people settlement around a pollution and possibly annoying industry? The politicians should take full blame for Sithalapakkams air pollution by Gold Winner and they must close the factory down. If you think my cause is right, please stop buying Gold Winner oil." />
