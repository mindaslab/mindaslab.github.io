Yet we see him work hard, hard and hard for a long time. Many people  do jobs they don&#39;t like and that are really not necessary  and get paid for it. The MBA people for example, all they do is to communicate stuff from one place to another. A telephone line would do that, and they get paid for that in huge, compared to other workers. The people who do the real job don&#39;t get recognition either, ask any one who built the Tajmahal and they would shamelessly say its Shajahaan, which blissfully ignores the thought off architects, works of craftsmen and masons and many other people. It also ignores the money that tax payers paid just to see it all end up in one large grave for a fucking bitch that seduced a brainless king.
