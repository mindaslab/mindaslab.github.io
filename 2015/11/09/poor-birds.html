When the rains were bloody heavy, I was watching out of my window, just then an humming bird came and sat on the window grill. I was stunned moved back and made a &quot;hissh&quot; sound and lifted my hands in reflex and it got afraid and flew away into the thick rain. Then when I was reading a book, another bird that look some kind of Robin came and sat on the very same grill, seeing me it flew away. Poor these birds, their habitats might have been shaken off by the winds and washed off cold by the rain, they came in for shelter and my fear drove them away. I wish they find a good livelihood." />
