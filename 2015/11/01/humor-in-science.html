<meta name="description" content="&#39;I hate this I.T business, a single client complains 100 things. I want to start a bonda shop where one out of hundred client will complain&#39; was my swearing in my office (about my clients ignorance) and all laughed, notably even the people who had newly joined under me. I was making a serious statement one that I thought never was funny, letting out my anguish, and people were taking it funny. A good bonda shop owner earns far higher than an I.T guy and its far less challenging as its straightforward. Any way thats not what this blog is about, its about science and humor. Its not about its better to be in bad job under a good boss than be inÂ  a good job with bad boss or some thing... Uh how bad bosses make you swear! I wake up everyday determined not to be one and I am not, that gives me immense satisfaction. I saw an interview with Crazy Mohan on a T.V channel and it was clear he was a engineer, a science guy. Recently I saw a documentary on Richard Feyman and he too was a humorist. Where ever I turn, good programmers have been people with good humor, thank God not unlike the MBA guys / gals, always dull faced and pursuing money than life.... Wonder really what goes on in their brain. Perhaps mystery of uncertainty and randomness can be cracked open if we can crack open brains of all bad managers on this planet, thus ending oligarchy and ensuring an era of peace. But I find people of science are great lovers of jokes too. I love science and math, and I love jokes and like to make fun too. Its quiet nice to see even me swearing inÂ  a bad patch of my life makes people smile. I feel so superior in doing that when others can find happiness in driving me to work for them in crazy way that makes me sad. Quiet simply we I.T people are like bottle openers, when our boss wants a drink we become valuable, when (s)he has opened the bottle we are piece of shit till the time the boss needs another drink. And when boss hand slips while opening the bottle, the opener gets trashed and thrown around." />
