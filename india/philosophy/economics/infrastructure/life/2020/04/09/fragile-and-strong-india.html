<p>It started to rain at 3:20 PM, not much, a light drizzle, there was distant thunder and lightning, and the power was cut, we got it back at nearly 9:30 PM. Just like that a 6 hour power break. I was wondering what to tell my boss. Corona has forced us to stay at home, and at home because of the fragile infrastructure of my nation I am unable to work.</p>

<p>This is Indiaâ€™s fragility. Modi wants to go abroad, speak on radio and T.V about the golden rule he is offering us, but no matter what scene you put, this is the ground reality of India. A nation capable of building a cutting edge nuclear reactor not more than 100 Km or so from my home, is unable to offer power due to a drizzle.</p>

<p>Now letâ€™s come to Indiaâ€™s strength. What strength do we have? Well, the population. â€˜Are you married?â€™, â€˜How is your family?â€™, â€˜How many kids do you have?â€™, are the questions we as Indians are asked every corner we turn. No one wantâ€™s to discuss politics, general knowledge, puzzles, economics any more, neither do they any other brain flexing activity of significance is liked by the populace, we talk to talk rather than to have a intellectual exchange. Even if Corona kills 10% of us, we will still be 900 million plus. Thatâ€™s a huge number, remember you canâ€™t even really comprehend what 900 million humanâ€™s are. Thatâ€™s our strength.</p>

<p>Every life reproduce, from a virus (which is half life) to us. Thatâ€™s the basis of life, and we Indianâ€™s have become really good at executing the genetic code thatâ€™s set into us. Our population has has become our strength. But at what cost?</p>

<p>Imagine a dog at a rich manâ€™s house. It chews away beef, chicken, if one is really rich possibly mutton and pork, or been fed dog food, and having a peaceful life and so on. Now imagine a stray dog, it has to eat fast, because if not some other might grab its food. It has very limited supply of food, just those thrown away in garbage, its life is free but with danger, it eats and multiplies and has kids like we Indians do. Itâ€™s life is really unsatisfactory like that of us.</p>

<p>The rich dog rarely has an offspring. Like fertility centers that caters to rich couple, there are breeding programs for rich dogs too, but for the poor it just breeds like us.</p>

<p>A politician is like the person in tea shop. Stray dogs approach him, wait patiently, he eats most of the biscuit or samosa or whatever and throws some luxurious food to the stray, and the stray is grateful for that.</p>

<p>Most Indian families are like stray dog families. You live to get married, gets kids, depend on some one else, hope that even if some of us are dead others will survive up to the breeding age.</p>

<p>The advanced civilizations, that has made the processors of the device you are using to read my blog are like the rich dog. They canâ€™t tolerate a power cut for a drizzle, they look at quality, try to keep numbers low, maximize productivity and resource availability for every one and depend on quality than quantity.</p>

<p>Which way our nation goes is in each and every familyâ€™s hands.</p>
