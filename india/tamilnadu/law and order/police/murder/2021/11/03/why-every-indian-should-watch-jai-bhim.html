<p>I follow some journalists on twitter, and one of them from THE HINDU tweeted a lot about Jai Bhim, I think even before the movie launched he tweeted how good it was. I thought he and THE HINDU were bribed by the producers of this movie. There was a reson, I think years before THE HINDU wrote lot of articles praising TATA motors, and TATA motors ads would appear in the paper. I bought a TATA nano and it was worst to say the least. So I have always doubted THE HINDU.</p>

<p>But any way since they were promoting the movie, I decided to watch hoping that it would be just another waste of time, but at least I can relax at that time and build more bad opinions about THE HINDU.</p>

<p>Boy oh boy, I was absolutely wrong! Wrong wrong wrong! The story is about a layer named Chandru or something, this guy helped oppressed people like workers, kuravars and many many more to get their rights.</p>

<p>We all know that Tamilnadu police treats us very badly. In the theft takes place, a cop does not know how to solve it (I think he was aiding the thief), so he arrests a suspected kuruvan who was there in that house for catching snake earlier. That kuravan had never committed the crime, the police torture him to death and plays a dram that accused escaped.</p>

<p>The police were super cunning and planted false evidences and witnesses to make people believe these people really made out of the prison. It took the brilliant work of Chandru to bring things to light.</p>

<h2 id="possibly-the-greatest-terrorist-organization">Possibly the greatest terrorist organization</h2>

<p>Jai Bhim is brilliant movie, it exposes possibly the greatest terrorist organization that’s there in this nation. If a terrorist kills, he admits he killed some one, and may be if we want to hang that terrorist, he won’t be afraid to be a martyr.</p>

<p>But Tamilnadu Police is far far more cunning, they want to inflict terror upon people, yet they wish not to die or get hurt by it. It’s a coward way of living, but that’s how Tamilnadu police is says this movie. It’s a slap on their face. but the police won’t bothe, I’m sure, they are far far evil to be shaken by a movie.</p>

<p>I felt bad, I go around telling my fiends to install solar cells on their roofs, urge them to buy electric vehicles so that we import less oil. Our oil spending is used by Islamic nations to fund terrorist activities against us just because some guy called Muhammad, who at that time starved in caves and illusion-ed that he met God’s angels told that Islam would spread to India. So bad! So these idiots now want to convert entire India into an Islamic nation. It’s a stupid thought, but that’s what they want.</p>

<p>But greater than them we have a great terror organization amongst us which we cannot reform or be destroy or change in any way. That’s the movies point. I feel it’s a good thing to bring evil to light.</p>

<p>Look no further, we have this Thuthukudi massacre which Edapaadi Palanisamy (EPS) did, he hasn’t been hanged yet (this proves that there is no difference between ADMK and DMK, and they have some form of nexus), a terrorist murdered people for EPS so possibly he can et lot from Vendata.</p>

<p>Next we have this Felix and Jayaraj who were murdered for fun by the police, and we all know those murderers will escape and we can do nothing about it.</p>

<p>Jai Bhim also tells about the Kuravar community. It’s possible they were in India even before Dravidian civilization took shape in Africa, and reached India via Mesopotamia and Iran.</p>

<table>

    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8a/7c/40/8a7c40aae9ef6d5a4e225e8cb0af0494.jpg" alt="" /></th>

    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Valli the Kurathi, new wife of Muruga welcomed by his first wife Devaiyani</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>They were the guardians of the forrest, fortune tellers, they brought us the wealth of nature without destroying it. It’s said Lod Muruga fell in love with a Kurathi and married her. But look now how we treat them? Agriculture has destroyed our forrest, and industries are destroying our agriculture. The Kuravars are left helpless, our system has shut out the true people of our land in favor of invading Dravidians and Aryans. that’s very sad.</p>

<h2 id="movies-should-be-like-this">Movies should be like this</h2>

<p>Usually Tamil movie is nothing but a love affair between hero and heroine, and before they can fuck each other, they have to do 4 dances, and the hero had to do 4 fights to impress the girl. That’s it. This movie is totally different. They want to make a movie this time and not a circus and call it a movie. That’s refreshing.</p>

<p>This movie looks so believable (though I believe the murderers were never hanged and managed to escape), and this is how movies should be. But I have no hopes for future Tamil movies, they just want to make money and will return back to cheap quality soon.</p>

<h2 id="you-must-watch">You must watch</h2>

<p>Only if we know evils in our society, at least we will start taking about let, let alone destroying it. No Indian has the balls to challenge these evils. At least know what these evils are and pretend to act like a man.</p>
