    <p>Today I heard the news that Jayalalithaâ€™s home will be converted to a memorial. I truly wonder why a proven criminal need to have one? Every person has two faces they say, I donâ€™t know how true it is, but even if Jayalaithaâ€™s another face was the C.M face, I donâ€™t think she is a person who deserved to lead a state.</p>

<p>There were times when traffic were blocked in the road just because this idiot wants to go for walk. We all know that her subordinates behaved like her slaves even in public. For her adopted sonâ€™s wedding, entire Chennai came to a stand still. She was all show even when she was in power. After all a show girl who looted our nation is now going to have a memorial.</p>

<p>Her character was also not good, many times, to tap in the sentiments of people, she has claimed that she was sexually assaulted, one of the claims I remember was she claimed that governor Chenna Reddy, a highly respected guy misbehaved with her.</p>

<p>Take Silku Smitha for that matter, she has made more hearts of youth throb than compared to Jaya. Has better fan base. She might not have looked so beautiful as Jaya, but she compensated with her professionalism and acting. Jaya may be a highly professional actor, but when it comes to politics she is an absolute failure. Many decisions she took looked foolish and like Tuglak she had to reverse many of them.</p>

<p>Even though Silk was a glamorous and soft porn actor, her character was never questionable. She did not become a C.M to cheat and loot people. No court has said she was a criminal. Unlike Jaya who wanted people to fall at her feet, Silku treated all equally as far as we know. However it must be noted that Shakila claims negative aspects about Silk.</p>

<p>Silk was so famous and has a better and cleaner soul than Jaya. Then why not her home be converted to a memorial for people to remember for ever? Why this society wants to remember criminal Jaya?</p>
