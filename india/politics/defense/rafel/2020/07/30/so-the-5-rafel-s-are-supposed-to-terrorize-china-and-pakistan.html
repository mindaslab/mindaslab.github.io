<p>Itâ€™s said that IASâ€™s officers donâ€™t like to work under Modi because most of their job would be to publicize what Modi has done. They despite their intelligence will be reduced to public realtionship officers. Itâ€™s also gossiped that far right Hindu groups have invested a lot in Indian news channels and have almost bought them so that they are a jaalara for Modi.</p>

<p>With the happening unfolding it looks so true. Yes India has inducted new combat aircraft after decades, but its five, thats it. Just imagine you write 5 letters in your exam paper and start dreaming of how you will become rank #1 in class, if that sounds so stupid, then this should also be stupid.</p>

<p>Rulers are elected to rule, to manage the nation, itâ€™s a very very big task. If publicity is all the thing that BJP thinks, I think actress like Shakeela can talk with France to purchase nuclear power tech, defense etc and no matter what she does we will get a very free publicity and likes.</p>

<p>Rafel is a engineering marvel, no doubt. I am an engineer and I understand the difficulty the engineers would have gone through to make it work. Just imagine we had one Kalaam and he was not enough to lift up the nation, similarly even a very good weapon in small numbers is not enough to defend a country. Right now we are getting a media flood about Rafel, and I think itâ€™s not much more than that in practicality.</p>

<p>Rafel is 4.5 generation aircraft, what ever the number means, but will the aircraft be able to run away  from very cheap set of 50 ground to air missiles launched against it? I doubt so. Even if it can escape many, imagine the pilotâ€™s fatigue trying to mitigate say 50 missiles launched one by one against him. Russians have found ways to detect and bring down 5G aircraftâ€™s and they are a defense based economy, and they will sell it to who ever can buy it.</p>

<p>I hope Modiâ€™s government does not waste a lot of money in Rafel propaganda. Imagine if we can give Rs 10 Lakhs to some one in rural area, they can set up a small business and give employment to few. Possibly 8 of 10 business will fail, but, I hope you get my point, by consistent investment you will get things going. Imagine if Modi spends that amount giving adâ€™s to media, it might not help the nation so much.</p>

<p>Do I think will BJP, RSS, Modi will change after me blogging like this? Definitely no. Possibly if 1000â€™s read it, may be ten of them will think before voting. If that person learns to think about politics, he will think about other stuff too. Possibly he or she can make others think. Thatâ€™s what I hope to achieve with my blogs.</p>
