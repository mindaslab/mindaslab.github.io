<p>It’s the Modi wave that has put BJP in power. When things are right we can see face of Modi everywhere, but now Modi seems to hide away from news. Yes BJP is getting shaky and its inefficiencies are starting to show off.</p>

<p>BJP seems to be a showoff government. It just wants to do many things for a show and propaganda without thinking weather it will really benefit people. They claim that the state has caught lot of money in demonetization and by implementing GST. In fact now fearing government whiplash, many businesses have started to maintain account books, tax revenue to the nation has increased. But where does the money go?</p>

<h2 id="price-of-petrol">Price of petrol</h2>

<p>Petrol now costs Rs 72/-,  a month ago it just costs Rs 65/-. If state is getting money,then why not ease petrol prices? Infact in that Rs 72/- about Rs 50/- is nothing but taxes to the government. Even if it can lower the taxes to Rs 25/- we can get petrol for Rs 49/-. That would be great boost for the economy.</p>

<h2 id="lack-of-railway-safety">Lack of Railway safety</h2>

<p>There have been two Train derailments in U.P alone. This after BJP government has raised the ticket price and has put additional cess tax on passenger safety. Where that all those safety tax money go? If it was put to improve Railway safety why we have derailments and deaths?</p>

<h2 id="privacy-concerns">Privacy Concerns</h2>

<p>There is this stupid thing called Aadhar that BJP pushed so that every one will have unique identification. For that Aadhar private info like name, age, address, phone number, iris and fingerprint scans were obtained. Now in a recent Supreme court judgment by a bench of 9 judges has said that one has the right to privacy. Now shouldn’t the government run a campaign and let people delete their personal information if they wish so? Why isn’t such campaign being held?</p>

<p>Plus the Aadhar software is not a Free and Opensource Software. We do not know whats happening in it? What bugs are present in it? How our information is accessed and manipulated? The government claims its safe, that’s it. Nothing more is said about it.</p>

<h2 id="law-and-order-fails">Law and order fails</h2>

<p>Ramrahim is a swamiji in India who is accused of sexual assault on woman and was found guilty. He supports the BJP. When news of his guilt reached out, his supporters created a huge carnage in Harayana, Punjab, Delhi and other places. There is a wide gossip that it was allowed to happen because of his BJP support.</p>

<p>When it was known that his disciples are kind of paranoid, why was the security not beefed up. More than 30 people lost their life in these violence’s.</p>

<h2 id="still-no-money-recovery">Still no money recovery</h2>

<p>Vijay Mallaya is a happy man in London. He owes Indian banks Rs 9000 crore. Thanks to his friendship with Subramaniya Swami of BJP, he is still free. SBI bank that lend him money is now taxing middle class clients to stay profitable, now it has become one of the most hated banks in India. Its gossiped that people are moving out of it in droves. The government seems not to take much note of it.</p>

<p>Modi famously said he will recover black money from Swiss banks and put a sum of 15 lakhs in every Indians account, because so much black money is out there that’s looted from India. But more than 3 years of rule, not even single paise has been put into the account. Wonder whats going on?</p>

<h2 id="ban-on-beef">Ban on beef</h2>

<p>The BJP has indirectly banned beef in the country. It has made selling cattle really hard and hence very difficult it is now to procure and slaughter. Plus unofficial Hindu terror groups are raiding Muslim and Dalit homes, searching their bags for meat and if they think its that of a cow, they beat them up and the law just watches because BJP rules with a Hindu ideology.</p>

<p>BJP has gone very low. Rather than putting laws for the good of society, its putting laws to modify peoples behavior. Its intervening in silly things like what people should eat. I can’t even believe a group of people with such a childish attitude can form a government.</p>

<h2 id="bullying-state-governments">Bullying state governments</h2>

<p>Just like the congress BJP is bullying state governments. We can see how (governor) Kiranbedi bullies (chief minister) Rangasamy in Pudhucherry. Okay the BJP is trying to catch the flaws of Rangasamy, but then how come Adhityanath the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh able to get away with child deaths in hospital which were caused by lack of negligence? Nothing is said about him just because he is one among BJP.</p>

<h2 id="black-money">Black money</h2>

<p>Modi famously said that if he came to power he would recover black money from swiss banks. So much will be recovered he claimed that Rs 15 Lakhs will be put into every Indians account. Till now not a single paise has been deposited into any Indians account by recovering money from Swiss banks.</p>

<p>There are huge business Tycoons like Vijay Mallaya who has cheated banks upto Rs 9000 crore and are living happily in Londoan. India under Modi seems not to have a heart to convict him and recover money. The banks who lend him Tax the middle class saving accounts to lower their losses. The government is keen on getting taxes but not keen on refining banks and make them more friendly to us.</p>

<h2 id="final-word">Final word</h2>

<p>BJP is shaky, not really good as I expected it to be. But still apart from Vijay Mallaya there seem to be no bigger corruption issues like the congress government, but who knows, there could be lot of corruption and we are unaware of it. There is still lot for the BJP to improve, it has to shake off RSS and outdated Hinduism to become a better party.</p>
