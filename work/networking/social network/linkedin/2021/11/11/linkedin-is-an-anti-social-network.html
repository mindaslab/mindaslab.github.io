    <p>I was on Linkedin and suddenly I received this notification</p>

<p><img src="/images/linkedin_2021-11-09 at 09-39-00.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What? I thought. Previously I was interacting with lot of Data Scientists on Linkedin, I was telling them about my <a href="https://datascience-book.gitlab.io/">Introduction To Data Science Book</a>, encouraging them to read it and tell their opinions about it. As Linkedin correctly found out, I was looking into lot of profiles.</p>

<p>One question I have for Linkedin is this. If Linkedin claims to be a social network, isn’t it a social behavior to meet and tell people about you and to know about them? Why is Linkedin is so pissed off by it and is blocking me from being social? I find it stupid.</p>

<p>Microsoft people usually don’t have brains. You can see it from how crappy their operating system is, how complex their Azure service is compared to Linode. They buy companies, inject their greed and management practices into it and let it get devoid of its soul. Such a sad thing.</p>

<p>I wish some network like <a href="https://diasporafoundation.org/">Diaspora</a> has a way to ask people their education and company details. Once asked it can connect people accordingly. That’s it, we have Linkedin competitor.</p>

<p>Linkedin does not generate its own data, people list data there so that they can be found, but Linkedin is doing the exact opposite of a social network. It’s obstructing people from contacting people who would like to be contacted. In other words its antisocial.</p>

<p>Diaspora and many free software social networks are distributed and open, they can develop an API where if the user is willing, any one can access their information and use it to contact them. This means by moving away from Linkedin, people will be truly linked in!</p>
