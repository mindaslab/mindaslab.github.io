<p>Iran has launched a satellite. This is as significant as nuclear bomb detonation during Vajpyee era. Why? Because when Indra detonated nuclear bomb there was Soviet Union to counter the ill effects caused by the USA, but during Vajpyee’s era there were no Soviets to help us.</p>

<p>India is a country that has had great thinkers all along. There were and are many great minds that shaped Indian politics, one of the earliest we know is Chanakya. Rajaji too was revered, Nehru’s non alignment policy got him support of half of the world. Though India was nothing economically during his time, he was admired by Soviet’s, Chinese, USA and perhaps by all other nations for his great intellect. The British naturally had respect for Gandhi. We have tall tall thinkers and hence our nation commands the respect of the world with ease, but for Iran that’s not the case.</p>

<p>Intervention by the USA had put puppet government over there, and it was overthrown by a religious one. Usually religion drags a nation as those that take on the scientific path race ahead. Take for instance Japan, after their painful defeat in world war 2, the Japanese leaders did not think their nation should be dedicated to the teaches of Buddha and Shintoism, they sought the best managers and scientific ideas from the USA. They surpassed USA in percapita GDP. Let’s take Pakistan and Bangladesh, Pakistan took the Islamic route, driven by their prophet’s words that India will one day be fully Islamized they try to destabilize us, wipe off Hinduism, Sikhism and other religions, now women in Pakistan are sold to China for prostitution. Bangladesh became a secular nation, now it’s percapita is more than that of India’s.</p>

<p>Iran is a religious nation, because of that it’s facing many problems. Israel is sabotaging it’s nuclear ambitions, Iran’s own young feel stressed by the dress and behavior codes, even a simple thing as heavy metal bands are banned in public. These are things that are unthinkable in India.</p>

<p>USA has hopes that foolishness of Iran will lead to it’s fall, but for some reason Iran has kept up. Now it has a space program. This makes me think, how that was possible. If a nation shackles itself with religion, then something else must be really good to keep it strong and going. I think Iran’s politician are great thinkers like that of India’s. Perhaps I feel they are play a grand chess with its religious leaders to balance USA, religion and aspiring youth. Or if all is under the control of religious fools, soon we can see a peoples revolution in Iran.</p>
