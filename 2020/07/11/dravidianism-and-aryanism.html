<p>We all know Karunanidhi could have looted and somehow escaped till last, there was another politician called R.Venkatraman who was also our president. There are no stains on Venkatraman as we know, he is so pure say like Manmohan Singh, Kalaam etc, none would even dare to think evil or try to frame up corruption against him. But this is what I heard about their families.</p>

<p>You see as government people, if there is any repair in their house say plumbing, electrical or any other civil repair, the Public Works Department (PWD) people would visit and do it, so we in the real estate would hear about them. This is what I heard about their families.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/R_Venkataraman.jpg/800px-R_Venkataraman.jpg" alt="R.Venkatraman" /></th>

  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In Venkatraman’s family, if one would visit it, the worked wouldn’t even be asked if he needs water, Venkatraman family could have been a strict Iyer family, and their strict austerity would have meant that they will never mingle with workers. May be the PWD people realizing this, never even asked or dared to ask something as plain as water to drink.</p>

<p>Now coming to Karunanidhi family. If people visit there, they say they might be interrupted by his wife Dayalu Ammal or Stalins wife and will be offered coffee or something to drink. The will be invited for snack or food, the woman and daughter in law of the house that would serve them. In short though you had gone to Karuna’s home as a worker to do some task, you would be treated kind of a guest, respected as equal human. People who went there to fix things would say that how simple the women in Karuna’s home were, women sat down and used <em>aruva manai</em> to slice vegetables they would say.</p>

<p>This is the difference between Aryanism and Drividianism. In Aryanism you have created and branded yoursef as Aryan and possibly as Brahmin because you think you are somewhat superior to others just because of your birth and / or because due to grace of God. On the other side there is Dravidianism which is essentially nothing, and makes no fuss, you are just a normal human being, mingling with others as though you and they are equal. Now imagine visitors visiting these two homes, who will they like to vote for? The Congress or the DMK with Karuna championed?</p>

<p>This is also the reason many people are moving away from Hindusim in India, mainly people who belong to caste who are not treated right even today. People who belong to so called upper caste look down upon them. I don’t think the BJP or RSS would revive Hinduism, it’s Hindus themselves must realize their mistake and treat all equal. This very behavior too led to the death of Sanskrit too.</p>

<p>Prakrit was the local language talked by Indians in the North and Dravidian languages like Tamil were talked by people  in South, but Aryans wanted to be different, they want to keep themselves above all and invented an artificial language called Sanskrit which was used for nothing other than to show their superiority and maintain secrecy. Books about old Indian lives tell that even women in Brahmin homes were disalloved to speak Sanskrit because women were considered impure. Such was and possibly is their level of austerity.</p>

<p>This also makes one thing clear, people of Aryan mindset can never fully rule India till the date Indians have rationalism and some sense of dignity left in them.</p>
