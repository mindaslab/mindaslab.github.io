<p>I would have never imagined I would work in Kerala. As a Chennai kid, for me Kerala is a place to go and get relaxed, where you can get a massage, live in boat house with food served by beautiful girl hostesses. I never imagined I would come here for work.</p>

<p>I was given a good cop and bad cop treatment at a company called Francium before, I hated that treatment. The same was happening to many good minds there, then we were fired saying that they wasn’t enough money in the company, while juniors were told that we were fired because of lack of performance.</p>

<p>This ill treatment of us, despite our professionalism, cut a deep wound in us, we were desperate to redeem, and out of many offers I got, I analyzed a lot. I must not get caught with another mad man or mad system once again I thought, the people of this company Guide House seem to have been behaving properly during interview and I chose it.</p>

<p>I got calls from Change Pond, a company near my home, and I think another company called VThink Global, just 5Km from my home.</p>

<p>Change Pond was pushy, they desperately want me in, they couldn’t control their desperation. They needed money from Ruby on Rails and a project was staring at them, they wanted me to negotiate with the client to bag the project. Well, I thought, these people don’t even have a RoR project and they want me. Let’s say a situation where the project doesn’t go well, they were denied payment by the client, don’t these people who are desperate for money pounce on me for not getting it? Possibly terminate me? So I said no.</p>

<p>VTink Global had no professional leadership, (very much like Francium Tech) it could be seen under the sun. Since it was near my home, I wanted to work as part time and try out my other stuff, like setting up an non I.T business. I offered to work there for 25 hours a week, they negotiated a lot / look uncomfortable on rates, then all of a sudden they wanted me to work there for 40 hours a week. This instability of their thought, without proper reason given made me reject it.</p>

<p>The H.R of Guide House behaved in professional way, the interview was done in professional way, the first round went about for 3 hours, I enjoyed talking to this girl Suma who was a technician too. Next I talked an hour with a guy called Suresh who was a director there.</p>

<p>Now one must not think Change Pond and VThink are evil and Guide House is holy, as with everything there is a mixture of all in everything. At that instance i was impressed by guide house. They did not change their mind, their talk was direct. I liked it. Unlike my previous company there seem to be no indication that they were hiding something.</p>

<p>Its like this, you know AIADMK and DMK are evil, so vote for Seeman or Vijaykanth. Does that make Seeman and Vijaykanth good or uncorrupt? No. When faced with madness, annoyance, loose talk and deception, I went with an unknown hoping it would be different if not better. That’s it.</p>

<p><strong>Thank You</strong></p>

<p>I would like to thank the H.R department of Guide House. People like Neeraj and Neetu assisted me well. Plus my friend Honest Raj who reffered me. He has that fire that an engineer should have and Guide House should be fortunate to have him.</p>

<p><strong>Have I stopped doing freelancing?</strong></p>

<p>Hell no. I am doing or should I say helping out people doing Data Science and Numerical Computing projects with Julia. My age old clients still pay money to keep their servers running. I have a bunch of friends in Chennai, Namakkal, Pondicherry who do Spark, Ruby on Rails and mobile app development.</p>

<p>I love tech and would like to talk to any one who wants to know how technology can improve their life and business.</p>

<p>I love freelancing, you can earn $40 an hour, get away with working 20 hours a week and have work life balance, but shouting out among many minnows and showing off to people aka marketing is difficult, so I have opted for a stable income as well.</p>

<p>Plus freelancing will have an enthusiastic client this week, next week the payment will be delayed and the next week you may not be able to contact him.</p>
