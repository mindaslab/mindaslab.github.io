<p>Any thing can kill you in space within minutes, even in times of stress you need to be calm. There was a knock at our gate today, our ex-driver it was. He seems to have had a safari near our home and dropped by, one of us engaged him outside the gate and rushed to the bathroom to have a bath, the conversation lasted 15 minutes I think. The people, and even families who worked with us seems to love us and seem to have extreme loyalties crossing generations, but does that warrant foolishness?</p>

<p>Chanakya said its not enough to be wise and intelligent, one must also avoid staying around fools. If one is around fools, their intelligence would be wasted. Think of what is happening here, the Church is open, stupid parents drag their kids to it, parents are taking kids to Tirupathi, I haven’t noticed mosques, but just today morning I saw a family of jam packed Muslims (our neighbors) in a car traveling from somewhere to our area. Pathetic. Not even in nightmares I have encountered a situation where I sould be in a place where I would be sourrounded by fools.</p>

<p>We are in a midst of an pandemic, I wish people reading this have the knowledge to look about it in the dictionary. People know it’s a pandemic and they invent reasons to travel, to mingle! I can’t imagine how stupid we are as a society. If those people who are idiots die I am okay, but if they spread virus around knowing or unknowing, that’s a bloody crime.</p>

<p>I wish schools one day start training people about psychology, about logical thinking, about staying calm during situations like these, possibly staying calm during one’s death too. I wish we had astronaut level of psychology training so that we don’t invent reasons to be a fool.</p>
