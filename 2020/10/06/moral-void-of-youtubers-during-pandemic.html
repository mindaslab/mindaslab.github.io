    <p>I’m a foodie and absolutely love food video’s and review. I want to go on an full India tour just to eat, I feel food and good taste are very essential and I feel no one should never go hungry.</p>

<p>This is a pandemic time. Usually during times of stress and in times when society needs to come together it’s the media people who pick up the task of educating people and they advise the right thing, but look at this video</p>

<div class="video">
    <figure>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zYoahr6n0g?color=white&amp;theme=light" allowfullscreen="">
     </iframe>
     </figure>
     </div>

<p>This guy looks well educated, may be he won’t get bankrupt if he does not do these video’s, drives a nice car, looks polished, but he still hops from place t place during pandemic which encourages people too to visit these places. I can’t imaging what is happening to peoples brain? This guy may be a fool, but not enough opposition arises against him or other youtubers.</p>

<p>Okay, mostly this guy won’t die of Corona, but imagine he has it, shows no symptoms, he might transmit it to some one old, and that person could loose their life.</p>

<p>What is puzzling is this, if I get Rs 10 from some one for an emergency I keep thinking all night why I did not plan properly and had to borrow, next day morning I give them money back. In fact even if I need change, I give a person Rs 100, get Rs 10 back so that I need not be in debt. In India we have such culture where we should not owe an debt or cause an evil to someone. These guys are Indians too, rather than advising people to stay inside, eat simple food, avoid travel and contact, they encourage it.</p>

<p>It is not this guy I am angry about, its all these youtubers who want to generate few bucks are behaving in such an irresponsible way. If they die it’s okay, its their wish, but they could harm someone putting videos now, I feel very difficult to digest that.</p>
