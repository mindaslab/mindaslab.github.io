    <p>I don’t know why I remembered this incident now, but anyway, a kind of funny thing happened long long ago. Opposite to the Medavakkam share auto stand there was and I think there is still a briyani shop, not hi-fi, but a very local one. Briyani over there was relatively cheap, and of good quality? I don’t remember the quality. Anyway….</p>

<p>Once I had a friend Senthil (he is a big shot in AIADMK), some how my busyness has left me without touch with him recently, he had a friend called Naveen, I think from Thankaasi, they both worked in Zoho. We 3, after just another meting where we planned for a Trillion dollar world conquering company, we thought of having nice treat. Who wouldn’t have briyani after planning about a Trillion dollar enterprise? We would!!</p>

<p>So we went to the shop we ordered chicken, something with lot of bones so that my friends felt good to hold and eat(, I always favor lot of meat chunk, more value for money you see). The chicken came, I think I forgot about the existence of this universe and started to focus on this chicken. After sometime Naveen started to breathe heavy, when I saw him he was looking at the chicken with great attention had bitten a piece and started to breathe heavy, okay, I started to dig into my pieces when Senthil said ‘let’s goto another shop, this place is not good’. I did not understand a bit.</p>

<p>We turned the corner and went into another shop, there we ordered the same Chicken lollipop, I think it came from the same local shop where we were eating, but since the ambiance was good this guy Naveen was okay. Senthil asked Navaeen, ‘you did not like the ambiance right?’ and Naveen noded.</p>

<p>I am BBC (born and brought up in Chennai), I really wonder how and why village people thought and communicated like that and I really don’t know how to read their fucking emotions. How could heavy breathing mean this thing and blah blah, but not ‘wow I love this spicy chicken!’. I really don’t get it.</p>

<p>In another case I had a friend called Umashankar who I met in Zanec. All people said very good things about him and I landed up forming a company with him called Trumatics, it was in Velacherry. Ideally it should not have all the evils Zanec had and it was supposed to take off great. But after sometime Umashankar used to abuse my work, he used to say very ill things and used to say Skikit-Learn, Facebook Prophet are totally wrong, which stunned me. Slowly I started to prove he was wrong and till that time he used to sit with us, he shifted to another room. Though he abused me before others, he pulled me up and said not to prove him wrong before others because that hurt his image.</p>

<p>One day when I went to file for tax, my auditors asked about the company, they rang up Uma, they knew I was super passionate. When I left, without my knowledge they rang my home up and seems to have expressed doubts in Uma, and said if Karthik is in right path he will be out of the company before next tax filing. I wonder how they got it in just 2 minutes conversation?! When I came out of Trumatics, then when people in my home revealed this to me, I was stunned by my auditors professionalism. May be Uma wanted me out all the time. Who knows? May be he set up something bogus company, who knows? I never ran my companies like Uma. I focus on how tech could help people and not how I could make money.</p>

<p>Uma is also from a place called Salem, a deep south city, may be he was communicating with me non verbally. But how to understand it? I have no clue.</p>

<p>We BBC’s have one motive in life, that is to be happy, from our young age we had everything and if we wanted something we asked for it. But looks like the rest of Tamilnadu, the rural India somehow seems to have this non verbal communication, possibly they were trashed by their parents for speaking out and revolting. Some how for them breathing heavy means we need to switch hotels, shouting like mad at very proven machine learning libraries in office means get out of my business and something.</p>

<p>Non Chennai people succeed, there is a psychological basis for it, for us being born itself is success, all our parents want is to watch us being happy and hence we have relatively no pressure. In rural India you have this family pride, your car should change from Swift to Mercedes in 5 years or the fellow villagers won’t respect you or something, so these non Chennai people if they don’t achieve something they fall into depression of failure, for us, ya we feel depressed when we fail, but a peg, a tandoori, a mutton briyani would fix it and none would bother about us, and we would bother about none.</p>

<p>Why I am writing this blog is, lot of Chennai people are in I.T offices which are dominated by south Tamilnadu fools who have these fucking old tradition thing and stuff. So when they behave mad at you, its their way. For us spitting, urinating, defecating in public is not right, for them even their best people do it. They are totally different. The solution for this, I have no fucking clue! :D</p>
