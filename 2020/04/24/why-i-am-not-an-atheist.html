<p>Many have asked me why I am against Modi’s govt but not against many other governments that are religious. For example Pakistan is an Islamic state, so much Islamic that they only only recognize Sunni sect as Islamic and others like Boras, Ahmedias, Shias as not a part of Islam. The answer is simple, India is my country, I don’t really mind if Pakistan, Iran or Indonesia does not develop and fall to depths due to religion. I simply don’t care about those people.</p>

<p>I also oppose DMK and AIADMK having alliance with PMK and Muslim League, these are parties based on caste and religion, they are as poisonous as BJP.</p>

<p>Now let’s come to thing why I am not an atheist. Imagine some one tells you take a plunge into a river and to swim against the current, you are with them on a dry land with no river in sight, you would think that person is mad. How can you go against anything that does not exist? Only a mad would imagine something exists and go against it. Calling some one atheist or anti God is similar. Where is God? What is God? Who created God?</p>

<p>Similarly there are no theist too. Say that you are lying on a perfectly dry land, paddling your hand and feet and saying that you are swimming with the river current, as stupid as it sounds, that’s what theist do, they imagine something is there and they say that thing loves and protects them and by surrendering to the non existent God they feel they are blessed by it.</p>

<p>What I would call myself is rationalist. We are the ones who don’t mind interacting with gods, satans, Ghosts, Sprits, Gobblins, Devils, Mickey mouse, Harry Potter, Poppye but where are they?</p>
