    <p>Iran cancels Ramzaan, a thing I wouldn’t expect to happen. A Nation that turned completely Islamic 40 years ago, now listens to its doctors and science. It was an excellent transformation! As a rationalist I am joyed to see it. But then few days back on April 14th, we Tamils celebrated our new year, people ventured out even in Corona intense places, they seem not to be concerned about the consequence.</p>

<p>Possibly going back a month or a month and a half ago, I was telling about Corona to my team back in Trivandrum, all were Kerala people and young, when I briefed them about corona their pupils dilated, their eyes became bigger, they had their desire to go home to their native. It was very different feeling I had, because in Tamilnadu, if I brief yong people about something, say like server crash or about some disaster, say warn about floods (which I did way back), they would take it into account, but would brush it off and go to work.</p>

<p>Today Kerala seems to have contained Corona, people over there are cautious about it, over here Corona is accelerating, and none seems to be bothered about it. Living in Kerala for a month, I feel Kerala people are gentle, and Tamils have some kid of rock in them, determined, they travel towards a goal or something not been bothered much about their feelings and fear.</p>

<p>There seems to be something in people in Tamilnadu that I feel is making them more adventurous. Take for instance our sport Jallikattu, we want to match ourself with this big beast. It’s only now the sport which is done in a bit sane way, but before liquor was fed to the cow, chilly powder rubbed on its privates and it was made to face the youth to have a aggressive Jallikattu. We simply did not bother about been pierced and torn by it, we welcomed it.</p>

<p>It’s not now, we have a saying ஆறிலும் சாவு, அறுபதிலும் சாவு (death at 6, death at 60), which means death comes at any age and don’t be bothered about it. The book of Pura-naanuuru hails of moms sending their young sons to battle, and feeling proud that they will die for the country.</p>

<p>Even in war, at the battle field Tamils followed tactics that would make others feel that we are crazy. War elephants were made to drink and sent amok in the battle field, bringing in panic and killing friend and foe alike.</p>

<p>Out of all civilizations in India, it was the Tamils that ventured far into the oceans, as far as Newzeland. And for what purpose? We simply don’t know. Even places in Japan that are suitable for habitation are named kudil (குடில்), why so? We may not know.</p>

<p>Right at the place I live, in Sithalapakkam, I find foolhardiness of people, and it has got a philosophical base. It was after coming to this place I heard about Hans, Mawa and Supaari, these are drugs which people use, especially the youngsters over her. When asked why, and asked wont it bring early death? Their reply was ‘கோள் புடிக்கும் முன் சாவு நல்லது’, that is it’s better to die before I need a staff for my support. I was astounded by this philosophy of a drug addict who possibly did not attend his scool.</p>

<p>It’s only after interacting with people of other states that I find there is something different in Tamil, a form of bravery, a form of foolhardiness, not being afraid of death, ignoring facts and Tamils feel comfortable being a stupid, perhaps unique to this region. Possibly it was this adventurous nature that made our language spread far and wide. Today our children call their parent’s mummy and daddy, whereas Korean kids call their parents Amma and Appa.</p>
