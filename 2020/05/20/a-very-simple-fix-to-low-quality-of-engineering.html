<p>I am an Engineer, a Software Engineer, but I studied Electronics and Communication engineering in my college. When I came out of my college and even now, I don‚Äôt know how to solder a diode to a PCB, or to fabricate a PCB. My college Panimalar Engineering was a spoof. It did have good teachers, but some politics threw them out. One of the HOD even said to us, ‚Äúhere we need to be afraid of rowdys who are punes now, as they report about us to the management‚Äù. That is, it‚Äôs said that when Jeppiar was a hand of MGR and was a liquor kingpin, he had lot of rowdies under him, then after MGR‚Äôs death they started these colleges and these rodys were made as punes and they spied on staff and students. In fact we were literally living in North Korea. Naturally we got vexed and threw our brains into trash and just obeyed the management as zombies. Our 4 years which should be a sweet memory are years which we don‚Äôt want to think about.</p>

<p>Not just because of these features, many colleges are technically incompetent. They are started by non engineer‚Äôs, people who have never practiced as engineer in the field and who doesn‚Äôt now what engineering is. Most are started by politicians who want easy money to run their parties.</p>

<p>These people naturally give headache to tech bosses like us, say we have a low budget project, we naturally tend to get the brightest and least experience person, we feel that new people out of college might be good after some training, but something happens in college that makes a person dumber than he was in his 8th std, college graduates come out really dumb, I don‚Äôt know why. It looks like even I managed to gain more knowledge under North Korean regime than these people who come out now.</p>

<p>As an engineer I was and am terribly upset, I had no solution or fix for it. But now I have found it out.  If the Tamilnadu government passes as a law it would be great, else colleges which say they provide quality education can take up on themselves and do it.</p>

<p>The solution is this. Say you get a fees of 1.5 lakhs per year to train a student, then let‚Äôs say that you get fees of Rs 6 Lakhs in 4 years. Lets say that the student has finished the college, give the student 1% of the total fees collection every month as compensation till he gets the job, So a student who is out of job after finishing the college for 3 moths would have earned a minor compensation of Rs 6000/- per month, that is Rs 18000/- in total.</p>

<p>When a student claims that he has got a job, then his degree certificate could be given to him, from that date on he can never claim any amount from the college.</p>

<p>Perhaps Tamilnadu government can force this upon colleges if it cares about it‚Äôs students rather than being a slave to rich barons. They possibly can even tell colleges to start an EPF kind of account called the non employment fund (NEF) to which colleges must pay it so that the student could draw it. India can even force online coaching websites to pay students compensation as well, or such sites could be marked fishy.</p>

<p>I feel Engineering colleges that are truthful, and that have confidence in them and are serious about their quality will surely take up such idea.</p>
