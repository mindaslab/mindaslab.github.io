<p>The world is engulfed in blind faith, the time I write now, even during the time of dire crisis, there are more people who swear by the existence of gods, satan’s, spirits and other supernatural forces, than those who believe in free thought, exploration of ideas, finding out truth by experimentation. There is a group in India which claims that Corona is false, and your illness are not caused by viruses. It’s a bane on this society that such groups are protected by law too. I feel those people should be put as frontline workers in Corona treatment centers without any protection.</p>

<p>During any crisis, blind faith surges, people think god is teaching us the lesson for our immorality and for badness in humanity, they never think why such a mighty force cannot create a uncorruptible humanity? But during this Corona crisis something has changed, data indicates that more people are following science, learning about virology and facts than calling their priests and spirits.</p>

<p>There are too many humans on this planet too, most of them only worth their dead meat, most humans are parasites too that are protected by law.</p>

<p>I want to put a strategy to fellow rationalist around the world, a way to destroy religion. If our theory that religion makes humanity inefficient and makes it go in a wrong way is right, then religion is a self destructive force. We have proof for it, we have Brahmins in India who have made that country into their slaves and unproductive nation for at least 5000 years. Islam has banned the eating pork which would have fed millions in middle east thus ending hunger for many, the war between India and Pakistan is based on the notion that Islamic people and Hindu’s cannot live together. The list goes on and on. Billions around the world have been made miserable, inefficient and have even been slain by religion.</p>

<p>On the other hand people who have followed science have grown. Edison did not say oh god shed light so that I can see in the dark, he worked and found the light bulb, Samuel Morse did not sit and meditate so that his thoughts transmitted to brains on other side of the world, he seriously invented telegraph using kind of scientific methods. The result, we got a world that could work into night even when the god made the sun disappear, we got a closer humanity when god separated us by huge distances.</p>

<p>I feel that we rationalist should ignore religious people, they are bound to get inefficient, bound to fail, and bound to follow science if they wished to survive.</p>

<p>A very good example can be found in India, where despite corona, a sect called Takrit-E-Jamat held Islamic meetings in Delhi, most of them got infected with virus, those people when faced with serious life and death situation did not run to their imams and pray to Allah for medicine to appear before them, they approached hospitals. Similarly a South Korean christian group almost surrendered after their meetings led to huge spread of Corona.</p>

<p>Today a mother carrying her dying child doesn’t run to temple, rings the bells and prays to god, she runs to a doctor who’s works are scientific. We have signals in junctions and proper education for the public to read and understand signals rather than a amman statue or vinayakar statue that in theory should keep a junction uncongested and smoothly running.</p>

<p>As rationalism progresses, humans are giving up their wrong beliefs, these people are rationalist without them knowing it, it’s like people who drink milk calling themselves vegetarians, these people call themselves god and blind faith believers without knowing they truly trust science and rationalism.</p>

<p>I think the way to defeat religion is progress, as a person following scientific way progresses, humans who are in blind faith and wants to improve will naturally shed his or her beliefs and would join us knowingly or unknowingly.</p>
