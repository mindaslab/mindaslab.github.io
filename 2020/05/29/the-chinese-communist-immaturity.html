<p>Long long ago, when President Radhakrishnan visited China, Chairman Mao greeted him, shaking his hand, President patted on Mao’s cheeks, embarrassing Mao. Though Mao was embarrassed, Radhakrishnan was all smiles as though he had met a child.</p>

<p>The ideologies of these two countries can’t be more different. One killed people to gain it’s current state, another countries leader was prepared to die for freedom and not kill or harm its occupiers.</p>

<p>India seem to have a magical soul, this country valued conscious life so much that most in this country are vegetarians. Not so long ago even before my home kolams were put using rice flour to feed ants, non vegetarian in my home is rarely eaten, things are changing though any way.</p>

<p>Right from my family culture I can tell you, we were implicitly trained never to be immoral, not to exercise our power over the weak, never to get seduced by wine, women, wealth. None told us, but if I just look at my ancestors way of living and if I see how much respect they commanded in society it speaks a lot.</p>

<p>The Chinese have that kind of morals too. They had Confucius, Tao, and others advising on the right and moral way of living, their beliefs and religion is as old as ours, they long for moral and spiritual knowledge and copied our Buddhism. But in a mad rush to show to the world that they are becoming a global power they have lost it.</p>

<p>India is a multiparty state with many voices, China is a single party state which wish to have just one voice, one brain and one thought. India has never invaded another nation despite enduring many, China today threatens India, Hongkong, Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam to name a few. It has simply lost the art of coexistence.</p>

<p>Indian Chinese border has nothing but barren and inhospitable land, yet both countries spend millions trying to control it, such is the height of immaturity. India is nation that respects all religions, but China says religion is poison and actively destroys it.</p>

<p>Though we have seen escalation of violence against Muslims and Christians in India after BJP came to power, it no way comparable to China where entire Muslim province in the west has prison grade security, possibly their population will be controlled slowly and their numbers will not rise and dwindle. Very similar to the case of Tamils in Srilanka.</p>

<p>Now after Corona, China has slipped to a new low. Xi Jing Ping came to power saying that China will be become great under him. Now we see how he handled Corona, though it has been contained in China, it let the virus spread to the world. Rather than taking responsibility of letting the virus out and silencing people of science and asking sincere apology, China simply wants to show the world how powerful it is and divert the attention of its people from Xi’s failures. That’s why we see aggressive moves against India, that why we see aggressive stand against Hongkong, though I must admit Hongkong is a integral part of China. That’s why China is beating if war drums, just to divert attention from truth and protect Xi.</p>

<p><strong>India Should Not Be Afraid</strong></p>

<p>India should not be afraid of China a bit. If we really start to loose a war we can nuke them, yes it’s suicidal, but that’s what we have to do. We simply cannot and should not loose out to these mad guys.</p>

<p>Even if conventional war starts, the worlds confidence in China would reduce a lot. The world is really pissed off by China, by the way it treated the crucial information it must have shared with the world, and it’s censorship of the scientific community. If India could raise the last billion in the war, we simply can outlast China, though with enormous losses.</p>

<p>China has got lot to loose if it looses the war. It won against us in 1962, but lost in 1967. It then lost almost all wars it fought, even once it fought with tiny Vietnam. China could loose Tibet, the Muslims of China would demand autonomy given a chance, Hongkong might become like Kashmir and demand freedom, and the dream of Invading Taiwan will vanish. Plus China will loose its aquatic territories it is occupying by bullying it sea neighbors.</p>

<p>I feel the good strategy is prepare for war, if it starts escalate it, and escalate soon to conventional missile war, then even if we still loose, make it a nuke war.</p>

<p><strong>Support Modi Idiot if War Happens</strong></p>

<p>If war happens we must support the government we have, no matter what regrets we have about him (the idiot who supports a religion that tells to eat cow dung and drink cow urine). Yes he has led us into financial ruin, he is doing idiotic tasks like opening up the nation amid Corona pandemic rise, but compared to living under the Chinese communist, BJP is far better. But once we have won, and Tibet and Taiwan are liberated, then we can demilitarize Indo-Tibet border and use the savings to build nation (provided our politicians then are not corrupt).</p>
