<p>Today morning, I went to my terrace for a walk. Apparently roads in Sithalapakkam are so bad that you can’t walk in them. Sithalapakkam main road is okay, but it has got not platform. With no police presence here you have lot of rash drivers, you will see drivers nearly grazing pedestrians here. You would walk, suddenly yoll see a car or bike heading towards you, yoll stop in confusion and at the last movement their vector would turn away from you and you will be relieved. So walking on Sithalapakkam main road is tough. Many many accidents have taken place and will take place too.</p>

<p>Okay back to the story, today morning I went to my terrace for a walk, and that smell of oil fumes and something dusty hanging in the air filled up my nose. I need to walk to get my brains working, that what earns me, makes me write this blog, and so on. But these smells in air emitted by Gold Winner oil company spoiled it. Today the smell was mild, but on some other days it would be too great.</p>

<p><strong>So how this would happen?</strong></p>

<p>In the process of heating oil or something, this company releases smoke via chimney. Now when the air near the ground is cold the air coming out of the chimney cools off rapidly, if the air above the ground say a 100 meters above is hot, this toxic air because of its low temperature and high density won’t rise up and would hang near the ground. So the pollution levels in the surrounding area increases dramatically.</p>

<p>Sometimes when going out of Sithalapakkam, while driving near Gold Winner oil company I do find that thick air, kind of dusty and oily to smell. In fact this happens when school kids go to their school in morning.</p>

<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>

<p>Well you see politicians going around in Sithalapakkam giving out new calendars, giving out free rice and other stuff to people as though they really care (none of us questions how they got the money, that’s a different story), why cant they drive around Sithalapakkam and surrounding and find that this is happening?</p>

<p>How come they are so concerned about us and so so ignorant of this pollution problem? What shuts off their nose and duty when they are in this area? People should think.</p>

<p>We have got pollution monitoring station here and there, it is in news now ad then, there is an industry in Sithalapakkam, is there a pollution monitoring system around? If yes where can we the resident’s  of this are able to check its reading?</p>

<p>I don’t think politicians and bureaucrats will help us, because something else might be helping them to have a great life. They could be getting enough to buy millions of air purifiers for their home, that’s why I have taken up this blog. Its you people who can help us the residence of Sithalapakkam. Don’t buy Gold Winner. If you are an actor and are been called upon to represent this company please don’t so it, or tell them about this pollution problem and deny them your representation.</p>

<p>If you quit them, our air get little bit pure, our kids might not suffer respiratory disease tomorrow, our old may not die early due to pollution, people allergic to smoke and having other respiratory ailments might find their health improved. I can have a good walk and improve my health and brain.</p>

<p>It’s up to you.</p>
