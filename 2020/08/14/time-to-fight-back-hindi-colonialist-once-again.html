<p>Looks like this fucking Amith shah is trying to impose something on us, possibly Hindi. It’s time to get our adrenalin pumping and fight those northern colonialists once again.</p>

<p>The North has always fancied conquering the South for long. If you take Ramayanam, its about a victory of an unworthy destitute from northern India over a fine ruler who ruled the South. Finally the Telugus, Mughals conquered us, and no wonder and the British did conquer us too. In fact people of Chennai and wealthy community of India, who were fed up by Mughals aided the British with wealth in conquering us. But at no time we lost our language.</p>

<p>During the Telugu (Kalappar) conquest, we lost our old Tamil script and moved to new one. This was refined during Periyaar times as we needed something to take advantage of the modern printing press, no longer we need to write on palm leaves, so we can leave out squiggly like characters that appear in languages like Malayam to Burmes which were formulated to be written on tender leaves. But all the time Tamil was Tamil. It’s even said that if Thiruvaluvar popped into existence today, he would understand what we speak.</p>

<p>Tamil had a grammar and reached perfection state (செம்மொழி) even like 5000 years ago. We eliminated imperfect pronunciations like sha, ha, gha, ish, long ago, possibly even before Prakrit came into being, possibly we could have done it in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) where we got our first written form. Yes cuneiform is a Dravidian script, it was called Tal (தள்), which means push in Tamil and other Dravidian language, because we pushed sticks into clay tablets to create it. Possibly Dravidians who came to India discovered their own writing very late after that. Today Hindi still has these incomplete pronunciations. Imagine the cognitive gap.</p>

<p>After we came below Vindhyas, Dravidians became very good at resisting things from north, possibly our war techniques improved. That’s why we still exists as Tamils till today. Our military might peaked in Chola period. We did not even hesitate to invade military schools in Kerala which was set to be created by Parasuraman’s disciple and was thought as invincible. Rajaraja’s invasion of these places (with ease) for spreading descent and Terrorism in Tamilnadu shocked Kerala like hell and created centuries of hate. Imagine, schools created by disciple of God been sacked like blowing dust away. Such super might, earned respect for Tamils. But we did then what Hindi people are doing to us now, we destroyed them completely and got the shit out of them and brought them to our ways. These people haven’t forgotten about it till now. Possibly that’s why Srilankan genocide was engineered.</p>

<p>All the way from Iraq to Singapore, many places have Tamil names. Just check the name of this mountain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Sikaram">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Sikaram</a>, where it is? What sikaram (சிகரம்) in Tamil means? What is the climate in Sudan (சூடு நாடு)? How is the sea shore in Eriteria (எரி கடல்)? What language isolated people in Cameroon (காமம் ஊர்) speak even today?</p>

<p>We find Thaayumaanavar representation in South America. Ancient ship bells in Newzeland have Tamil inscriptions on them. And these Hindi people think of imposing stuff on us.</p>

<p>When India got independence, it was promised made to minorities that their beliefs and culture would not be touched.</p>

<p>But look whats happening? We almost lost our Jallikattu. How many of us name our kids based on Sanskrit and Arabic names? In Dravidian culture women can worship and do pooja to God. How many temples have women priest now? We prayed to God in Tamil before. Today in marriage you don’t know if a Brahmin tells you to fuck your wife or tells the Gods to fuck her first. Yes we pay him for that. Yes it’s true that India was sexually very independent in the past, so those stuff were tolerated, and it became ultra conservative as it is now somewhere in the middle. Every religious text describes the beauty of God and Goddess and what they did in vivid detail. Indians saw these things as very normal things like we say to our friend today that we had idlis this morning. A whole section in Thirukural is dedicated for this, but won’t it be better if a Brahmin tells to the groom who would like to fuck his wife first in Tamil rather than in Sanskrit?</p>

<p>Today Islamists are so bold that they demand Tamil muslims to ditch their language and pray to god in Arabic, fuck! Some how many mulims who I know feel Arabic is the way to worship God. In this regard the Arabs are no different than Aryans invaders who tarnished our culture. The funny thing is, there is no proof that prophet Muhammad existed.</p>

<p>We do not have Tamil literature for Science, a very serious drawback. Tiny Japan has it in Japanese. Germans do their engineering and medicine in German. I should be ashamed of typing my blog in English. We have let English, another imperfect language to conquer us.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to know about this one nation one all theory. Will Amitshah admit that his father is not his father but Gandhi is his father? Because we live in one nation so we all must have one father! Will he admit Indira is his true mother, and his mother is nothing and fake? Then why he or any one can’t admit some one else is their parent, want us to admit another language in our minds. Tamil is our linguistic mother and it will always be.</p>

<p><strong>A New Tamil Desam</strong></p>

<p>I would be happy and not worried if things flare up and we get our own country. Definitely we are doing far well above Indian average. We are the most urbanized state in India. Our development is homogeneous  compared to other states. We don’t have religious violence here, and people d reject caste politics.</p>

<p>If we are separate nation, lot of countries will help us too. Countries like Srilanka, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, Malaysia, Singapore, Mauritus have Tamil as their national language and may stand by our side. Our diaspora would love to see our nation lifted. Plus we can have a say weather or not we can allow people from North can make a living here, thus we can prevent our way of life from getting corrupted. We can have our kids studying for medicine and science without an external government and cultual interference and so on.</p>
