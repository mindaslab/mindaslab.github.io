<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/6052/6322071540_2bbf975b27_b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>An Auvaiyaar song goes that there are two types of castes in this world, one is the higher caste which has the heart to give and help, and another is a lower caste which is stingy. But it says one is a higher caste only if one gives in a right way.</p>

<p>Long long ago people were giving wealth in a wrong way too, that is they were bribing. That’s why she explicitly mentions we must give in a right way.</p>

<p>The poem also talks about caste, it says there are only two castes, that is she means to say to the people please leave your caste system and just look at people as they belong to these two castes. This means back then Tamils had the cancer of caste right in their nerves and blood.</p>

<h1 id="corruption-without-corruption">Corruption without corruption</h1>

<p><img src="https://newsd.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karunanidhi.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Karunanidhi is considered as the father of corruption in India. It’s not because he and his family are corrupt and introduced dynastic politics in Tamilnadu, but he can be openly corrupt and escape with it. Back in Indira days, Indra tried to crush him by exposing his corruption, but the officials appointed by her gave up and termed the kind of corruption that goes on here as scientifically corrupt.</p>

<p>Though some in India are getting caught and facing arrest because of corruption, it’s this DMK template of corruption that many follow and escape.</p>

<h1 id="you-can-get-away-with-any-magnitude-of-corruption">You can get away with any magnitude of corruption</h1>

<p><img src="https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2017/12/21/648968-untitled-design-56.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The 2-G corruption may amount to 1,70,000 crores, an unimaginable sum. Raja and Kanimozhi (daughter of scientific looter) were charged in that, but they escaped just like that. How? Okay if no money was looted why did the CAG go so wrong and why there is no investigation against the CAG? You wasted so much resources of our nation to bring false charges on someone! Why there were mysterious suicides in Tamilnadu of people who might be related to this case? We simply don’t have the answer.</p>

<h1 id="proven-corrupt-can-be-the-god-mother">Proven corrupt can be the God Mother</h1>

<p><img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2014/09/jaya759.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Jayalalitha is a proven criminal, yet the state of Tamilnadu is running a criminal government saying that this is Jaya’s government. That is they claim that a proven criminal is the moral head of state and whole India watches on as though…. fuckin God what to say about these Indians?</p>

<p>I wonder if I can run a government saying that Kasab, Osama are the moral leaders, I might still get away.</p>

<h1 id="you-are-a-shit-unless-you-are-rich-and-powerful">You are a shit unless you are rich and powerful</h1>

<p><img src="https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/6/10/w900X450/J_Anbazhagan_EPS_Photo.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When people die of Corona, their bodies are treated like shit. Literally they are just tossed into a large pit with a bleach and it’s covered. one might say that the government employees who handle the body are afraid of the infection are are too  afraid to touch the body. Okay fine.</p>

<p>There was a DMK leader called J.Anbhazagan who died, and he died of Corona. His body was preserved properly, put into a nice coffin, was lowered into his grave slowly and with care. This proves that if you are a commoner in Tamilnadu, perhaps in India you would get no respect. You have to be rich and powerful to be treated as human.</p>

<h1 id="its-okay-to-be-a-psychopath">It’s okay to be a psychopath</h1>

<p><img src="https://hwnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/tamil-nadu-960x540.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are two traders in Tamilnadu (pictured above) who were tortured and killed in Tutthukudi district. Gossip says that the police who killed him might be of different caste. Any way, the way in which the police killed him was horrific. Iron tipped lathis were sent into their butt, their hair pulled out of their chest, they were beaten like hell and so on. This incident shook the nation. But take it from me the police guys who had done it won’t be hanged, mostly they will come out unscaled.</p>

<p>Psychopath Tamilnadu Police is there to protect Psychopaths and they will.</p>
