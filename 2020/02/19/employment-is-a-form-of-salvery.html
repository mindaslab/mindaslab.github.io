<p>Thinking about employment it is a form of slavery too. I long thought getting a loan was a slavery. Yes, loan is a slavery, you write off part of your life to a money lender and you are bound to pay it. Now think about employment. The moment you agree for a job , you are bound by some rules. Far worst if the person giving you salary is a evil guy he will change the rules for the worst. You are left with a feeling of control because you have simply walked into the shackles of employment.</p>

<p>Thinking further, people who have money are using your desire for a decent living to shackle you. The moment they don’t want you, you are threatened with less decent living, loss of dignity so on and so fourth. Some may say that for people who work hard these things don’t matter as they can work their way out and produce more. But think, donkeys work hard, but its the washer-man is the one who enjoys the riches. Women in Africa work hard like fetching water from distance source, fetching firewood and so on, but they are still poor. Think why?</p>

<p>I am quite convinced over here emotions come into play. A person with resources feel that this person is worthy of getting it more than the other one because of so and so reason, and he gives the resource accordingly. And the wealthy’s resources are protected by law and the law is skewed in capitalist society to favor the wealthy as they are the people who are close to power than the people who don’t have wealth.</p>
