<p>I donâ€™t like DMK for many reasons. The first is dynastic politics. We all know who is the next chief minister after Stalin is. Itâ€™s hard to believe none in DMK did not work as much as Stalin to deserve the CM post, and itâ€™s kind of funny to know why there wasnâ€™t a vote or a contender to Stalin when he tried to become the leader of DMK, that too when DMK claims that itâ€™s a party that respects democracy.</p>

<p>Apart from that DMK is the epitome of corruption, possibly the most corrupt organization on this planet. Itâ€™s said that they have made looting a scientific process thus making it untraceable. I would have been very happy if something other than DMK, ADMK came to power in Tamil Nadu. Any wayâ€¦</p>

<p>Was seeing the news today. What DMK is doing to Hinduism is great. Actually in Hinduism God is equal to all, so just a particular Brahmin caste doing poojai in temples is bullshit, DMK is trying to reverse that. Looks like very soon any one from any caste can become a poosaari and do poojai in temple.</p>

<p>In reality any one can be a brahmin, the title brahmin should not be given to someone who is been born to a brahmin, but it should be given to some one having very great personal qualities. For example A.P.J.Abdul Kalaam fits very perfectly into the description of a brahmin, but he is a staunch Muslim and yet a brahmin. Some how things changed and now a person born to a person who claims he is a brahmin is calling himself a Brahmin. Somewhere down the line things were hijacked.</p>

<div class="video">

    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K0HqkC0jbJ8?color=white&amp;theme=light" allowfullscreen="">
     </iframe>
     </figure>
     </div>

<p>So letting all caste people to become poosari, DMK is demolishing the myth that God is accessible to us only via brahmins, a myth that has gripped this nation since Aryans set foot on the Indus valley.</p>

<p>Another thing is, if you have noticed, women in our house do the poojai mostly. Before Aryanism took over, women in society were priests. In ancient India there was almost no difference between a man and a woman. After the arrival of Aryanism, womenâ€™s rights got reduced and they were pushed away from God at least in the public places. The arrival of Abrahamic religions, namely Christianity and Islam, cemented the myth that women are subordinate to men. DMK is trying to reverse that. Now women too can become priests in Tamil temples. Thatâ€™s great. In fact Amman cult which is relatively untouched by Ariyanism and other invasions still has many temples whoâ€™s priests are women. Non vegetarian is served in the temple as prasatham, animal sacrifices are allowed. DMK has always stood by womenâ€™s rights and these changes are laudable.</p>

<p>Finally this language issue. God is equal to all and could be called out in any language, but the myth that Sanskrit is a deiva bashai and Tamil is a eecha bashai has been spread by Aryans. Till today a Tamil canâ€™t understand what the poosari in Temple tells to the gods when he prays for him. One sould be able to understand what the poosari says to God. In Tamil Nadu Tamil should be spoken to Gods, not some extinct language. DMK is bring Tamil into temples, now any one will know what is been prayed for them.</p>

<p>I thank Stalin for these stuff. Despite giving power cuts and disturbing my tranquility and profession he is doing good to make god equal to all. I thank him and the DMK and wish all the very best to Dravidian movements success. the ultimate success would be eliminate God itself and make people see the truth, but itâ€™s not the right time to take such drastic move.</p>
