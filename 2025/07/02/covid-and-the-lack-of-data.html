    <p>It was the second covid wave recently. In the first one we had decisive announcement from the government and strict actions were taken. In the second none. Experts were saying covid was spreading, but people behave like fools, like they were immune, as though they had the ultimate control, and as though nothing bad could happen.</p>

<p>To make matters worst, I used to go and sit in my friend‚Äôs office because he requested me so, and from their behavior (just by seeing how they approach tech issues), I could infer none would sanitize their hands, none would use masks, the office was packed, filled with non thinkers, ignorance dominated their brains. I feel sorry and not sorry for them. I also knew from the behavior my friend, that he will not declare holiday to slow spread the virus.</p>

<p>What appalled me was the lack of data and information this time. I had to go to X, type ‚ÄúCovid India‚Äù in search and try to find out. There were deaths, and there were people who acted as though nothing happened. The government gave no solid information which people could follow. On one hand they said they were ready with beds and oxygen, and on other hand they said that there is nothing to fear. I wondered what‚Äôs the truth?</p>

<p>None were following precautions, I think herd immunity saved us this time. I wonder what would have happened if COVID found a new way to kill us all of a sudden. Thankfully it did not happen.</p>

<h2 id="modi-and-lack-of-data">Modi and lack of data</h2>

<p>We have a Prime Minister called Modi, who is an illiterate person. I think he himself has admitted that he worked in tea shops. Under his rule, I think the stats department is dysfunctional. Being uneducated and non-intellectual, under his rule, India could have hid true COVID deaths. During the first covid, during the 19‚Äôs and 20‚Äôs, a lot of people migrated to their hometowns and died on the way. Modi has no data collected about their deaths.  We have our leader with such immense stupidity.</p>

<h2 id="stalin-and-covid">Stalin and covid</h2>

<p>It was during last COVID, my state chief minister Stalin got elected. You must have seen his election campaign, there would be no COVID precautions. He or his supporters never wore masks. I don‚Äôt think anyone sanitized their hands. Yet after winning the elections and becoming the chief minister, he was shameless enough to ask Tamil people to donate money for the governments fight against COVID.</p>
