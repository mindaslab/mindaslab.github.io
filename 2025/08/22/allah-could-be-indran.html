<p>Muslims around the world worship a single God called Allah. But that was not the case before Islam. Allah was the king of many Gods, Just like God Indran in Hindu Mythology. In fact Indran was once widely worshipped in India, and then I think people cooked up negative stories about him and he lost his fame.</p>

<p>Both Allah and Indran had three daughters. I think in Hinduism, at least two the daughters of Indran, named Devaiyani, and Valli got married to Muruga. Jayanthi was another daughter, by winning over Sooran, I think Jayathi (which means victory, or sometimes birth) became one with Murugan too.</p>

<p>In Christianity, their God is highly forgiving, but in Islam, Allah is very strict, just like Indran.</p>

<p>Allah was once represented by crescent in Arabia, though Islam forbids representation of God, still the pagan way of crescent is used. Even today Muslims worship a stone called Kabha, revolve around a building that houses it in Mecca, all remanence of pagan practices.</p>

<p>Moon in India is called Chandran. Did the ancient Indian the moon worship of Chandran slowly morphed into Indran? Is it Chandran of the Induâ€™s, which became Indran? Did this Chandran King of Gods move to Arabia and became Allah, the king of Gods there? I donâ€™t know.</p>

<p>If you look at religion and myth, the same stuff would be copied and morphed to fit needs. Take Soora Samharam, and Ramayana, very similar. Jesus is nothing but retold story of Mithra, which appeared in Rome 2000 years prior to Jesus era. As the Jews say, Jesus never existed. Even we have no proof of prophet Mohammedâ€™s existence, and all could have been a spoof to bring people in line to an ideology, align then to a way of life. The concept of heaven and hell were invented by Zoroastrian, and many other religions copied it. ISlamist dropped eating pigs to market their religion to the Jews. So nothing is original.</p>

<p>I strongly feel, Allah is nothing but the retold and morphed story of Indran, the king of Gods.</p>
