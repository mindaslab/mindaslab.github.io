    <p>Education increases the chance of one being rational and calm, but it’s not always the case. Take for example Rajaji, he is extremely educated, well regarded, but he advocated religion, blind faith, gurukula system, and told that son should follow fathers path in profession. Now take Periyaar, I think he studied till 4th standard, but when it comes to reforming people, he had better ideas, which fortunately Tamilnadu adopted and is reaping dividends.</p>

<p>People need to be trained to look into facts, they must have rationalist thought, if someone says there is God, and he wants you to do this and that, one must ask ‘why that fucking God is not speaking to you?’, you must think why its showing partiality? Why can’t it elevate everyone to the level of Nanak, Jesus, Mohammad, and Saints, and why it has only the power to interact with only some people, and why it expects us to obey them?</p>

<p>India is country that unfortunately recognizes religion, religion is based on beliefs and not facts. Even today we have a religious government, a Prime Minister called Modi, under whose rule in Gujarat, a genocide took place. In such a country, how could we expect people to have an education that will teach them to question things, probe for facts and come to possibly a right conclusion?</p>

<p>Just imagine the irrationality of the Delhi attack. Within 2 minutes the lost lives will be filled by births, in 24 hours the road will be mended (it’s a VIP and prestige area, not like the places we commoners live), normalcy will resume, things will be forgotten. Even if terrorists managed to nuke 5 Indian cities, all at once, India will survive and will not give up.</p>

<p>This bomb blast would have only brought misery to doctors family who did it, given India more intelligence to crack down on terror, and would have brought extreme misery to the people who have died. One day if India reclaims the stolen territory of Pakistan, it will be as cold as Israel invading Gaza, may be no mercy would be shown, millions of innocent lives there will be terminated, or put into disarray for nothing.</p>

<p>Ultimately all the terrorists have achieved is to make the nation speak their name for possibly a week, instead they could have helped many to become doctors, treated people well, could have become tall figures in their community.</p>

<h2 id="revamp-education">Revamp education</h2>

<p>First we need to do is to <strong>ban religious schools</strong>, that spread a falsehood that some great power called God exists. People should be thought that God is a product of dissolutioned mind, a product of mind with less facts.</p>

<p>The second thing that needs to be done is <strong>remove all traces of religion from our curriculum</strong>, let the parents of kids tech them religion, or if the God is so powerful, let him install religion into everyone’s brain.</p>

<p>The third thing we must do is to <strong>teach kids to think like a philosopher</strong>, teach them to question everything, tech them how to look at facts, probe for truth.</p>

<p>Then final thing is, we must also <strong>teach them science, and history</strong>, which are full of facts.</p>

<h2 id="educational-dark-age">Educational dark age</h2>

<p>Unfortunately we in India are living in a educational dark age, education is politicized, Religion is brought into politics, management ethos are forgotten and idiots are made to rule our nation, and states. People don’t even know how to choose a right candidate from voters list.</p>

<p>Even if educational reforms are implemented, it will take decades for bright and debating minds to emerge. Till that day we have to face the poison of religion and irrationalism. I think India will never become a rational nation again.</p>
