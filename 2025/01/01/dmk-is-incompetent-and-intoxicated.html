    <p>I feel DMK has become incompetent and intoxicated in its ruling years, I am sure the Stalin family cares about getting Inbhanidhi on stage during DMKâ€™s meet, than solving our problems. In this blog I present case why I think DMK is intoxicated and incompetent, and why we Tamils need to choose alternatives. I am not sure though if alternatives are ready, but it would be foolish as a civilization if we are not looking for it.</p>

<h2 id="failure-to-select-a-right-leader">Failure to select a right leader</h2>

<p>DMK failed even before Stalin became a CM. Itâ€™s a party that says it likes to be democratically represent us, but inside DMK, there is no democracy. Somehow Stalin, Udhayanidhi and Inbhanidhi have risen to the top. What qualification do they have? They just come from a single bloodline.</p>

<p>Even PTR comes from a blue blood, but he is intellectually sound. On the other hand Karunanidhisâ€™s heirs looks like fools.</p>

<h3 id="stalin-is-a-fool">Stalin is a fool</h3>

<p>Stalin is a fool, or he thinks we Tamilâ€™s are fools who will forget what he has done, here are my cases:</p>

<h4 id="senthil-balaji">Senthil Balaji</h4>

<div class="video">
    <figure>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QUZ8X55WdUs?color=white&amp;theme=light" allowfullscreen="">
     </iframe>
     </figure>
     </div>

<p>I saw a video where Stalin slams Senthil Balaji, about his corruption, look what has happened now, Stalin kneels to Balaji, he is dependent on Balajiâ€™s money so much so that when Balaji was arrested, Stalin and DMK came forefront to defend him. Such aâ€¦â€¦. God, what to say? What to say? To be descent, I would just put, such a shameless character now leads DMK.</p>

<h4 id="campaign-against-drugs">Campaign against drugs</h4>

<div class="video">
    <figure>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hb5BGb_vixU?color=white&amp;theme=light" allowfullscreen="">
     </iframe>
     </figure>
     </div>

<p>It was funny when I watched this video. Here Stalin says a word <em>bothai</em> which means intoxicated. He does not want Tamils to be intoxicated with drugs, but just from Medavakkam to Sithalapakkam, a 3Km stretch, there are 7 Liquor shops run by Tamil Nadu government. Donâ€™t they give <em>bothai</em> or intoxication? Does Stalin say itâ€™s right to drink, but itâ€™s wrong to take drugs? If yes how? Does he say that my neighborhood and I have not been affected by TASMAC (Tamilnadu Liqour Shops)? Does he claim no one sat on our street and drank? Does he claim drunk donâ€™t roam our streets? Or does he claim a drunk does not come in the way when we drive and increases the potential of accidents?</p>

<p>Stalin looks like an idiot when he intoxicates people, but says they must not get intoxicated by a competitive intoxicant like drugs.</p>

<h4 id="covid-spreading-election-campaign">Covid spreading election campaign</h4>

<p>You must have looked at election campaigns in Tamilnadu, they took place in Covid era and none of protective measures were followed. Stalin and other leaderâ€™s grouped people and addressed them. They were mask-less, and no visible proof of hand sanitizers were present. Okay Stalin is a fool, no wonder.</p>

<p>The funny part is after coming to power, the same Stalin who helped to spread Covid, asked people to donate money to prevent the spread of Covid. I think he thinks we are absolute fools who do not watch him. I felt very bad that DMK came to power with such a stupid as leader. Or at least he thinks we will be stupid enough not to notice these things.</p>

<h2 id="a-murder-near-court">A Murder near court</h2>

<p>There was a <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/tamil-nadu/story/tamil-nadu-tirunelveli-murder-man-hacked-district-combined-court-2653271-2024-12-21">murder near court campus</a>, okay, the issue is when reports asked the law minister, he almost disowned the murder as though it never happened in Tamil Nadu. He was proud that it happened out of the court campus than inside it, and it sounded like it was the triump of the DMK that enabled one be mudered outside court campus.</p>

<p>Shouldnâ€™t a minister feel asamed when one is murdered in Tamil Nadu? Okay we know that politicians are scoundrels, but at least act.</p>

<h2 id="tungsten-mines-in-tamil-nadu">Tungsten mines in Tamil Nadu</h2>

<p>There is a <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/whats-the-row-over-tungsten-mining-near-madurai/article68959810.ece">conterversy over tungsten mining in Tamil Nadu</a>. The opposition leader EPS asked questions about it and the CM M.K.Stalin couldnâ€™t answer it properly. When stalin came to power, what ever problems he faced, he blamed it on the previous leader EPS. This showed us that he likes to deflect off things than to think about solving it, once again in the tungsten issue, he blamed it on center.</p>

<p>Yes the center wants to mine tungsten, and it might want to auction Tamilian lands, but you are a ruling party in Tamil Nadu. Have you protested against it? If not why all of a sudden you are blaming the center? Why were you sleeping till now?</p>

<h2 id="blast-in-coimbatore">Blast in Coimbatore</h2>

<p>There was a <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/all-about-coimbatore-car-blast-case-2022-terror-probe-and-more/article66061346.ece">bomb blast in Coimbatore carried out by Islamic terrorists</a>, it was unprofessional and sloppy, probably made by a terror intern or trainee. It was bomb made from domestic gas cylinder.</p>

<p>Rather than acknowledging it was a terror attack, DMK people to get Islamic votes said that it was an accident, I couldnâ€™t believe it. At that time a DMK guy came to my home to get trained in web development, and he swore that cylinder blast is an accident and not a terror attack. I was baffled. This shows to what length DMK people will go to keep their vote bank intact even though national security is compromised.</p>

<p>Savukku Shankar is a whistleblowing journalist in Tamil Nadu who is equated to Julian Assange. He somehow knows and accurately predicts whatâ€™s going to happen in politics. He also exposes corruption in such a way that infuriates the DMK. Rather than proving that Savukku is wrong, or placing an argument against him, DMK arrests him in false cases, so much so that Supreme Court of India has given stark warning to the government.</p>

<p>This proves that DMK does not like democracy, and does not like people questioning them and speaking against it. The reason why this happens is, DMK is intoxicated with power, and has become incompetent.</p>

<p>About 6 months ago I think, an IAS office named Radhakrishnan told on TV that after the incidence shown in above video (it shows a little girl being attacked by a cow), cows in Chennaiâ€™s roads will be eliminated. I am sure even if I take a stroll now, I would be able to spot cows on road, cow dung all over roads, and worst, the cows affecting traffic, and causing a potential for accidents.</p>

<p>Lies, lies, lies from Radhakrishnan. Absolute lies. The government, even it knows the truth, it hasnâ€™t apologized for this guys lying, neither has announced how it will remove cows from roads.</p>

<h2 id="not-eliminating-dogs-from-road">Not eliminating dogs from road</h2>

<p>An incident occurred in Chennai where a little kid was bitten by stray dog, when the mayor Priya was asked about it, she said the city will take census of dogs. What? Idiot, eliminate dogs idiot, eliminate it. Good or bad, dogs are like terrorists across border who still donâ€™t attack us. Donâ€™t be a fucking sitting coward like Modi, eliminate them. DMK doesnâ€™t seem to have the guts to change such a mayor.</p>

<p>When I ask my friends why such an incompetent and inefficient person is a mayor, they say itâ€™s because she is from a backward community. Okay you need a person from backward community for votes, but then why canâ€™t you find an efficient one from backward community and make her or him mayor? If one is not performing, shouldnâ€™t that one be eliminated?</p>

<p>Is DMK a lazy party? Selecting a president because someone is a son of Karuna than someone who has the will to think about the people? Is the same laziness happening in Chennai mayor stuff too, though one is not performing, the party is reluctant to take her out and put new one in?</p>

<h2 id="flood-prevention-for-chennai-complete">Flood prevention for Chennai complete?</h2>

<p>In recent light rain, Valluvar Kottam was flooded, and I put it in my WhatsApp status, a DMK friend of mine replied that only 1800 of 4000 crores allocated for flood relief has been spent. What? I thought. Mayor Priya said within one rain Chennai will be flood proof, now Valluvar Kottam the work is still going on. I think in next light rain, or may be the next day, Moggapair was flooded. In how many places the anti-flood systems are still being implemented? In how many places it has been implemented and when it was last checked for maintenance? Who are the contractors who implemented it and how much money was given to them? Who are the people who worked for the project? How much money they got? From where the raw materials were procured, and whatâ€™s the supply chain? As a citizen why itâ€™s hard for me to find this information online? Whatâ€™s so secret about implementing a drainage system?</p>

<p>There is an excellent leader called Palinivel Thiyaga Rajan in DMK. Of course, he is a leader in party because his family is close to that of Stalinâ€™s, but he is not a tainted man, and he is an intellectual who does his job right. An audio leaked where PTR exposes 30,000 crores looted by Udhayanidhi, PTR claims thatâ€™s a fake audio, but after that, PTR who was finance minister declined. Now I think he is I.T minister.</p>

<p>A man who speaks with statistics and hard facts, PTR should be chief minister I say, we need such a talented man, not some idiot nod head like Stalin who is only good for photo shoots and propaganda.</p>

<h2 id="murugan-festival">Murugan festival</h2>

<p>DMK which is supposed to be an atheistic party, to the dismay of many atheists who supported it, it held a festival for <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/dmk-govt-to-hold-global-lord-murugan-fest-faces-bjp-flak/articleshow/108507745.cms">lord Muruga</a>. I have always maintained, Dravida Kazhagam is the atheistic party and DMK is an Aryan Brahminical party.</p>

<p>Okay things have deteriorated to a level the members of DMK follow God. Even if we treat that as personal belief, as a party which is now governing Tamil Nadu, I expect DMK to free people from the shackles of religion and move the masses towards science rather than plunging into the darkness of blind faith. DMK is in-fact dead, the DK soul of it has long rotted and vanished, DMK is just a name now that means nothing.</p>

<h2 id="dmk-people-in-my-area">DMK people in my area</h2>

<p>Have you seen how ruthlessly cars with DMK flags drive? First I wonder whatâ€™s the use of cars to identify themselves with a party when all humans are equal? Why canâ€™t people be normal and civil? Identifying oneself with a party sends a signal that that person is incompetent and needs a huge organization to support him to shield him from in societal misdeeds.</p>

<p>Okay let me tell about DMK people in my area. First on December 18th gone, I returned from office and there were speakers blasting about Aiyappan praises just one house from my home. Even if all doors and widows were closed, the sound penetrated our home, kids were crying. I was told that some DMK guy is going to lord Aiyappan temple and wants the world know about it. I got a headache, and this speaker blasting went till 10PM. None dared to asked them to shut up because we know DMK people are bone head rowdies. Police wonâ€™t be of help too. Things ended at 10PM, next day I was unwell because I couldnâ€™t take rest and did not go to my office.</p>

<p>I think a second incident happened in EPS rule. There were rains and floodwaters in our street rose rapidly, this should not happen, Sithalapakkam is no flood zone where people have been living for more than 1400 years. The flood was because a DMK guy at the end of our street had built a bund so that his car can roll down from his property onto the road, this bund was blocking the draining of water to Perumbakkam lake. This DMK guy was asked to remove the bund did not relent. He said if it broke, the flood water will reach the slums.</p>

<p>He doesnâ€™t seem to know we bought our properties legally, his bund construction that obstructed water and caused flooding is illegal, and the slums are illegal settlements too. As the waters rose, amazingly middle class people started amass and booked a JCB and the bund was broken. This is one simple example, if people wake up, DMK or no other party can stand before them.</p>

<p>A party is built from ground up, and if people without simple civic sense constitue a party? Why should we vote for it?</p>

<p>DMK is a brahmin party, consisting of God believers. Whereas we Tamils want administration be separated from oneâ€™s beliefs.</p>

<p>In fact DMK came to power by licking the feet of Rajagopalachari (Rjaji), a corrosive man who want to implement Vedic and Aryan traditions in our land subjugating our people. Periyaar supported Kamaraj who implemented his schemes, Rajaji unable to stand the march of rationalism in our land supported DMK, so that Periyaar and Kamaraj could be defeated. By this way Aryans could get their wishes implemented in Tamil Nadu in the name of Dravidian politics and cause.</p>

<h2 id="karunanidhi-shouldnt-have-become-dmk-president">Karunanidhi shouldnâ€™t have become DMK president</h2>

<p>I donâ€™t think Karunanidhi should have become the president of DMK in the first place. I feel more honest, and more atheist Neduncherian should have been its president. Somehow politics do not favor gentlemen and uncorrupted and honest people, after the death of Annadurai, Karuna became CM and Tamil Nadu was scotched by the rising sun.</p>

<p>Yes lack of education, foresight and thought might have been prevalent in uneducated masses then, there must have been a lot of people who canâ€™t think well in DMK then, but what now? Havenâ€™t your parents sent to school? Havenâ€™t you learned to think? If not, why?</p>

<h2 id="a-new-party-a-new-rule">A new party, a new rule</h2>

<p>I am not saying to put back EPS in power, far worst will be BJP who are hell-bent on destroying our culture and language. What I am saying is look at alternative parties. Vijay has formed one, Vijayakanth has formed one, Seeman has formed one, there is Pazha Karupaiah who I really respect, he has a party, there are the communists (but yes they have become DMK feet lickerâ€™s now), and so on. Vote for different people, let us use this election and show that we need a change from this duopoly of DMK and ADMK.</p>
