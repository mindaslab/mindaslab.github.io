He has failed to lead, after the deaths happened in his rally, he proved himself coward and fled to Chennai rather than stand with people who have suffered and died for him. Neither Vijay, nor his party TVK, seems to have no inkling of guilt, they are unapologetic till now. They have announced price for lives lost, and price for injury, thats it. As the courts once said, Vijay is not a true life hero, just a hero before the cameras. Vijay however filed a case and made the court retract this statement.

    <p>If you are a powerful (wo)man in Tamilnadu, you can get away with the murder. This is the writing on the wall I could see. The recent culprit is actor Vijay. He has killed 40 people, and nothing happens to him. He has failed to lead, after the deaths happened in his rally, he proved himself coward and fled to Chennai rather than stand with people who have suffered and died for him. Neither Vijay, nor his party TVK, seems to have no inkling of guilt, they are unapologetic till now. They have announced price for lives lost, and price for injury, thats it. As the courts once said, Vijay is not a true life hero, just a hero before the cameras. Vijay however filed a case and made the court retract this statement. But the statement made by the court is the truth, time has proven it.</p>

<p>The history of killing innocent life’s, and politicians being unapologetic is a long one in Tamilnadu, the so called Tamilian leaders have been no beeter than the Brits in this regard. Now let’s see one by one, how major politicians killed innocent people and still remain unapologetic.</p>

<h2 id="stalin">Stalin</h2>

<p>Tamilnadu under stalin I believe has at least 28 lockup deaths. Not so long ago, I think 63 people died in drinking illicit liquor. Stalin who was heartbroken by this 40 deaths in Vijay’s rally, stood firm and unapologetic when he killed these people. He simply didn’t care.</p>

<p>Even before coming to power Stalin started to kill Tamilians. Watch his election rally, it took place in covid times, and DMK took no measures in preventing spreading of the disease. Once elected into power, Stalin shamelessly asked Tamils to donate, so that he can fight the disease which he spread. Not even EPS apposed to this evil preelection campaigns of Stalin, because he too followed no covid guidelines.</p>

<p>There was an Airshow conducted in Chennai, it was very poorly organized and 5 people died in it. The DMK government closed the mater and swept the dirt under the rugs. They are unapologetic till now.</p>

<h2 id="eps">EPS</h2>

<p>As I said before, EPS too campaigned as though there was no covid, had no regard for Tamilian lives. He is famous for killing atleast 12 activist who protested against the Sterlite copper factory in Thuthukudi. ADMK and EPS are still unapologetic about it, he played a drama to the media that, its only after watching the news that he knew the murders had been committed. The whole state knows that police will not resort to firing without orders from the CM, Its not simple matter to fire on people, it should be done only after lot of approvals.</p>

<p>It was in EPS time that all people who were associated with the Kodanaadu Jayalaitha property robbery case died in mysterious circumstances.</p>

<p>In EPS era too there were lockup deaths, the most famous case was that of Felix, and Jerald I think. Father and son duo was tortured in lockup and lilled by the Tamilandu police, just because they had verbal spat. None who is associated with that case is hanged yet.</p>

<p>Both Stalin and EPS are super weak CM’s who are unable to control the Tamilnadu police, no matter how barbaric the police becomes.</p>

<h2 id="karunanidhi">Karunanidhi</h2>

<p>2G case was going on, Kanimozhi was in a soup. The civil war in Srilanka was on, the Sinhala forces had the upper hand. As a leader of Tamils, Karunanidhi should have stood up, prevented the defeat of the LTTE, but he stood down because he need to concentrate and save Kanimozhi from the 2G case. Then DMK threaded the line of Pranab Mukerjee and said that the war was over, while Sinhala troops were mascaraing Tamils en-masse. Finally this led to the death of Velu Pillai Prabhakaran, the hope of Tamils. Even Prabhakaran’s young son was killed.</p>

<p>Just to save his girl, Karunanidhi wiped of an entire Tamil civilization.</p>

<h2 id="jayalalitha">Jayalalitha</h2>

<p>Jayalalitha is one of the worst Chief Minister’s ever to rule in india according to me. She cared nothing about people. Traffic need to wait for hours, just because she wanted to take a walk on the roads. She was shameless, totally irresponsible.</p>

<p>It was some holy festival called Mahamagam. Jayalaitha had gone to some crowded place to take a dip in some holy pond or something. There was a private area for her to be drenched in holy water. Her arrival itself added more congestion to the crowds. Just to disperse the crowds, its said that some police guy called Walter Devaram shot rounds in the air, the crowd panicked. There was stampeed, and people died. ADMK is still unapologetic till now.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Periyaar was right when he said that independence of India is a black day. He said the only the skin color of the rulers will change. Just like General Dire has no concern for life and killed a lot in Janian-wallah-bagh, India’s post independence leaders have no concern for the lives of people. They are intoxicated by the power, wealth and richness, and they think they are untouchables.</p>

<p>A society is like a stew, scum floats to the top often and it need to be stirred often to break the scum. I feel that we Indians are  ot stirring up India often, we are not scaring politicians often, neither we have <a href="/2010/01/31/dynamic-democracy.html">Dynamic Democracy</a>, and we have decided to be their slaves forever.</p>
