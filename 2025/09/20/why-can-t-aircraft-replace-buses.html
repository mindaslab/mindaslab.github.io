    <p>A few months back, a friend of mine took me to Banglore in a bus. I couldnâ€™t sleep in the rocking motion, and because of the the stale air in the bus. It was hell. The next day I had to attend a tech summit and I had to keep my concentration alive.</p>

<p>Months before that, may be even a year ago, I had to travel in a sleeper bus in Maharashtra, it was equally hell. I just couldnâ€™t sleep. We arrived at a destination at 2PM, I was so disillusioned because of the sleeplessness, I thought we arrived at a 5-star hotel. It was only the next day I really found out it was marriage hall. But the trip was memorable, Maharashtrian hospitality aced!</p>

<p>I do wonder how people travel in buses? And I also wonder if people needs to travel in buses? Why canâ€™t we have lot of cheap Aircrafts that enable us to travel between cities? Yes I do hate airport checkups, but air tavel does save time. Yes economy class seats are crampy, but its for a short duration. We need faster transports.</p>

<p>One way of doing it is opening more airports, for some reason, India is very slow in that. Another thing is to privatize railways so that we have better trains, and trains that run faster. Plus we also need innovative transports like airships, and helicopters a lot, and cheap. Why not autonomous aircrafts?</p>

<p>I have a dream where a person should be able to go from any city from India, to any other city, within 2 hours, and that too whenever he wants. This will change the dynamics and truly integrate India. I want the busses, the old clunky, rocky way of travel, to die.</p>

<p>I think the first stage of killing slow busses is more airports, and air travel, this also includes airships, and helicopters that need less infrastructure. The second stage is faster trains that rival aircrafts. The killer stages wil be hyperloops, flying cars etc. I feel India is too slow in providing revolutionary transports to its citizens.</p>
