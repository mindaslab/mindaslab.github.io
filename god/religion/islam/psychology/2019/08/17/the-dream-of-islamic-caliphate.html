<p>Some times your peace and well being is affected by some idiot thinking some thing. Have you have ever had a bad day just because your bosses brain has got crooked? Well that’s the fate of India too, and possibly the fate of Europe. There was this guy Muhammed in Arabia who thought the then Arabic religion sucked, so he came up with Islam. If some one today claimed that one had seen God or Angels, you would be put in a mental hospital, but in those day they believed in him because he was a honest tradesman. Even very honest people’s brain gets screwed up.</p>

<p>Now not being content with what he had, he said this Islam will spread to India, Rome etc. That is he just blabbered that Islam would spread to «all the countries that came up to his head», and that’s it, our fate was sealed. You see, Islam and all religions in this world are not religions of peace. We suspect Aryan’s invaded India, hence Hinduism cannot be considered a religion of peace. Buddhists masacare Tamils and Muslims in SriLanka and Burma. You have the crusades where Christians killed lot’s of Muslims. Similarly at that time Islam spread by war and conquest and not by people accepting it in a peaceful way.</p>

<p>If Islam was a peaceful religion, the original religion of Arabian’s would have peacefully coexisted with Islam, and today Kabba would have been worshiped not just by Muslims, but of the people of the old religion too. Islam just wiped them out, forced them to change.</p>

<p>Its set in Muslims brains that one has to conquer to spread Islam, now since they believe in Muhammad’s blabbers, it means that Islam must conquer India too, otherwise the God man is not really God man! Its that’s why they try to conquer India so hard.Though many Muslim nations have given up turning India into a Islamic nation, Pakistan for its strategic interest still tries to do so. It control’s Afghanistan and since it has got one of the best and most successful intelligence service, the ISI, it does have the capability and the desire to control India. We have to be terribly careful.</p>

<p><strong>What’s an Islamic Caliphate?</strong></p>

<p>Conquest of India by Islam is a part of the Islamic caliphate plan. Right after Muhammad’s death, Muslim’s were searching for a leader. They had the idea that there must be just one leader and under him the whole world should be ruled under the Kuran as its the book of God. So time and again some powerful Islamic ruler rises and tries to unite Muslims under him and tries to invade non Islamic territory to keep the dream of Muhammad alive. Till now they are bit successful. Islam now stretches from the gates of Russia to Indonesia. At the same time these leaders have failed too as they embraced violence and covert tactics to spread their religion, just like Muhammad has done during his life time.</p>

<p><strong>What we must realize</strong></p>

<p>There is no fucking God. We all know it. We take our kids to a doctor when its ill rather than taking it to a temple alone thus avoiding science. If God with such greatness exists, it wouldn’t have freaked out just because some one has disobeyed it and ate a fruit. It could have fixed the brain of the disobeyed, perhaps reversed time and made the thing of eating the forbidden fruit never had happened. If God is sooo dumb, my God what to do about it? Its worth killing it.</p>

<p>People should realize that God is just a feeling, an illusion in one’s mind. One must come out of this trap and must embrace reason and common sense. Else we will see more bloodshed in the name of religion of peace.</p>
