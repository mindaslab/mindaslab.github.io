<blockquote>
  <p>If voting made a difference,
they wouldn’t let us do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As middle class of India, we run this nation. Vijay Mallaya, Neerav Modi, Lali Modi, loot and get away abroad, here this Modi boasts he does this thing and and that thing and does nothing but to crash our economy even before the great pandemic. For every loss our baapus make, the looting that our politician do, tax evasion our bosses make, we middle class have paid ta for it (like huge taxes in petrol, even salt and toothpaste is taxed, our income too is taxed) and we are the true citizens of India. We never felt proud about it as we are looted every second, and we never boasted about it. We have always felt things are out of our hand, and thats true.</p>

<p>But time is very strange, it gives an opportunity for us to change something. I am not talking about Democracy. No matter what ever party comes to power, they will obey the rich and ignore others. I am talking about energy.</p>

<p>My house is on a dirt road for the 14 years of my stay in Sithalapakaam, we had nothing but dirt road. Vehicles pass, and even for minimum of traffic dut gets settled every where in my room. Imagine if we can reduce oil import, save our nation money, say we save Rs 100/-, I am sure Rs 99/- will be looted away, but the Re 1/- might go into making my road a tar road. So please read this blog to know hw you can save my country.</p>

<h2 id="why-modi-wont-eliminate-terrorist">Why Modi won’t eliminate terrorist</h2>

<p><img src="https://theindiaobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/31895204_10214039392993167_7017601988976181248_n.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Modi is simply stupid. In his short rule, Vajpyee fought Kargil, exploded nukes, brought Pakistan to its knees, with 7 years of Modi rule he must have liberated Boluchistan and Sindh from Pakistan, instead he sank us into despair with demonitization. One of the reason given was terrorist have their money in Rs 500/- and Rs 1000/- notes, and if this demonitization happens it will cripple them. Are we free of terrorism now?</p>

<p>Modi simply has the ability to make news and do nothing in reality. He just wants fame and an illusion to surround him, that illusion is he must always feel that he is the greatest priminister ever, which is rubbish. I think he is competing with Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi to become one of the worst priminister this nation had.</p>

<p>RSS, BJP and Modi need the Arabs, the Terrorist, because they are organisations that is built on hate of Muslims and Christians. If these people are gone, then it becomes pointless for them to exist. The same way Pakistan military needs India to justify its existence to Pakistani people and loot them.</p>

<p>Modi is just a show. He can’t eliminate terrorists.</p>

<h2 id="prophet-muhammed-did-not-exist">Prophet Muhammed did not exist</h2>

<p>Now let’s come to Islam. None knows if Prophet Muhammed really existed.</p>

<p>Even if he did, he is definitely disillusioned person. We have lot of swamiji’s that claim they have seen God, heard God’s messages. Do we believe them? We feel they are better off meeting a psychologist than telling idiotic stuff.</p>

<p>Today we have tools of science and lot of documentation to probe into the brain, but imagine war torn Arabia, they never had these tools and these thoughts we have now, and they suffered a lot. So lot of messiahs rose. One of them could be Muhammed or he might have been a person who was made up.</p>

<p>Ramayana was written because Aryans envied us and wanted to conquer us. They want to paint us as monkeys and demons, they wanted us to be some one who should either serve them or be destroyed. In similar way the Arab had their eyes on India and Rome, both are very profitable trading regions. It’s very possible that they inserted text into Quoran that it’s the will of God and words said by Muhammad that Islam would conquer Rome and India.</p>

<p>Though many nations have left the desire to Isamize India because we have been steadily raising in power ever since independence despite the huge corruption we have, the existence of Pakistan cannot be justified if India wasn’t its enemy, so its holding onto this dream. Being a Sunni nation, Saudi Arabia supports Pakistan in all ways possible, because any nation thats controlled by Islam is a territory controlled by Mecca which os owned by the Saud’s for now.</p>

<p>We must be very careful with Aryans and Arabs. Or we will be known as slaves in History.</p>

<h2 id="we-want-khaliphet-in-chennai">We want Khaliphet in Chennai</h2>

<p>I am very certain that still the idea of Kaliphat, that is all of the world should be ruled by a single Islamic leader is there in the minds of many hard core Muslims. Rather than the acknowledging the progress we humans have made, outgrowing religion and growing into science, these religious leaders want to take it back. Not even a decade ago I think a friend of mine told me that while he was travelling in bus in Mount Road, may be somewhere between the U.S consulate and Thousand Lights mosque he saw a bunch of protesting Muslims who were shouting “we don’t want democracy, we want kalipha”. He was shocked, because these muslims were in Tamilnadu and had grown with us and had been an indispensable part of us, yet somehow they are controlled by the age old Arabic thought.</p>

<p>We must be very careful of these forces.</p>

<h2 id="oil-or-energy-is-islam">Oil (or energy) is Islam</h2>

<p><img src="https://media.gettyimages.com/vectors/oil-derrick-inside-symbol-of-islam-vector-id516214527" alt="" /></p>

<p>Few days ago I saw an article that Saudi Arabia wants to be a leader in Hydrogen future. So they now know people won’t buy into this Oil myth any more. Islam, the radical one, some may say it’s not Islam at all, is now fuelled by Saudi Arabian Oil. The Sauds know that the world is shifting, even though batteries can store renewable power, to store in such huge quantities as the world energy needs grows, there isn’t known Lithium deposits that are present on Earth. One of the best was t store power is by splitting water, and storing that Hydrogen either liquified, or as ammonia or as methane.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Arabia is blessed with Abundant sunlight so they can split up water by electrolysis and ship the hydrogen. We in India who have abundant sunshine, buy hydrogen from these terror sponsors, we will be killed by them possibly even into the next millennium. This should stop.</p>

<h2 id="use-solar-power">Use solar power</h2>

<p><img src="https://sustainabilitynext.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/solar-panels.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So what can we middle class can do? Much of middle class live in flat system or in rental homes. This blog is not for them. For people who are living in their own independent homes consider switching to solar power. The initial invest would be high, but it will pay off.</p>

<p>First electrify your home with solar, this will cut our nations coal import. Next if you are using LPG for cooking, disconnect it, move to electric stoves, microwaves and electric ovens. In fact we are getting our LPG from possible terror sponsoring nations. Next buy electric car, it will charge over night using solar power stored in batteries, so in the morning its like having a car who’s petrol tank has been filled for free. Plus electric car means less maintenance. This when done by lakhs of Indian middle class families will surely give a blow to these nations that sell us energy and use it to conduct terror attacks on our nation.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-dont-trust-the-government">Why I don’t trust the government</h2>

<p>One might say the government is doing solar power projects and big companies are involved in it, so why should we do it. I say why not? We know the speed of the government, we know that government can play politics and it’s easy for them to get bribes from few power companies than some how forcing 1 crore or so middle class families to bribe them just because we now produce our won power.</p>

<p>Next a central provider means transmission losses, these can be cut if power can be obtained from our roof tops. Even if its power companies are private, you can’t say there is no politics and corruption inside those corporates. So power lines may fail one day. There is chance of having monopolies and duopolies so nothing good happens to us ultimately which roof top solar avoids.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>History does not give the weak and oppressed much chance. It gave us a chance in 1940’s as Hitler tried to invade Britain and we used it to gain independence. Now I feel we are getting a rare chance to circumvent politicians, religion, corporates who are oppressing us now to get partial power independence. Let’s grab it.</p>

<p>May be if 10 billion dollars are saved a year, may be out of that 100 million might be put for public use after 99% corruption, and possibly in that some money might be used to convert the dirt road I live in into a tar road, thus improving my standard of my living.</p>

<p>Its all in your hands.</p>
