<p>Recently a bunch of North Indians had chased and bashed Tamils in Tiruppur. Tamilnadu government says there is some fault on Tamils too. In recent Coimbatore bomb blast too DMK people claimed that it was a cylinder that went off, they defended the terrorists in open sun without shame.</p>

<p>We canâ€™t trust DMK, all they need is to make Udhayanidhi Stalin as CM,a and after that Inbanidhi. To achieve that, they would let the northerners occupy and destroy us.</p>

<p>DMK has joined hands with Congress which is a northernerâ€™s party. The Congress needs Hindi heartland votes. DMK needs support of a pan India party so that they wonâ€™t get persecuted in criminal and corruption cases. So DMK will behave like a Hindi party. No doubt about that.</p>

<p>Plus DMK and Congress want dynatic politics and never will they want to put rightful ruler on throne.</p>

<h2 id="dynastic-politics">Dynastic Politics</h2>

      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/E._V._K._S._Elangovan_at_Marriage_Function_12.jpg/1429px-E._V._K._S._Elangovan_at_Marriage_Function_12.jpg" alt="" /></th>

<p>DMK is a pure dynastic party. When India got independent, I think we made 100â€™s of kingdoms secede and we made it into one India. When Kingdoms lost power, naturally those people were liberated from dynastic rule and rule of democracy blossomed. But DMK, Congress and even other parties are brought in dynastic politics withing democracy which I think is ultra dangerous.</p>

<p>Erode east does not belong to Elangovans family. I am sorry for his sonâ€™s death, this has left Erode East a void constituency, but I wish Congress was able to find a non dynastic person who truely love the people of Erode than to make a dynastic one stand in elections.</p>

<p>To his credit I must say Elangovan is a very good person comparatively to other scoundrels in politics. But the way his family (Elangovan and his living son), tried to have them nominated by congress for Erode East leaves me with bitter feelings.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-aiadmk">Why not AIADMK?</h2>

<p>I donâ€™t like AIADMK because itâ€™s led by EPS. He conducted Thoothukudi massacre and AIADMK as a party watched rather than impeach him. Kodanaadu people have died under mysterious circumstances and we public have no information whatâ€™s going on. May be EPS is a super killer who knows to get away with things. We must be very careful.</p>

<h2 id="vote-for-naam-tamizhar">Vote for Naam Tamizhar</h2>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/NAAM_TAMILAR_PARTY_LOGO_MODERN.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I do not believe Seeman, the leader of Naam Tamizhar is a pure person. Savukku Shankar has laid charges against him, Seeman was smart, visited Savulku in prison and stood support, now Savukku does not speak about Seeman. Maybe both have become corrupt now.</p>

     </div>

<p>Further more even if Naam Tamizhar is corrupt, and they get elected, they must build connections to start looting en masse, this will give us some breathing space. They might not be as efficient looters as DMK and Congress people.</p>

<p>When it comes to purity of soul, Naam Tamizhar is okay comparatively. I am not telling there are no robbers, scoundrels, looters, money hungry businessmen in it. I just donâ€™t know who are there in the party. But relatively itâ€™s pure. May be if DMK and Congress are HIV infection for India, Naam Tamizhar is Tuberculosis, maybe it will take more time to kill India.</p>

<p>Naam Tamizhar has never kept alliance with other parties that have proven or unproven corruption record. I see that as a Major plus. They speak against Noth Indians aggression against us. DMK needs Congress and ADMK needs BJP so they wonâ€™t stand for Tamils, wheras naam Tamizhar will as they do not bow to North India. I see some form of Tamil spirit left in Naam Tamizhar.</p>

<p>As a citzen of india, as a Tamil who feel we must be protected in our last refuge (we must not become like Srilankan Tamils), I urge the people of Erode East to vote for Naam Tamizhar. I am not saying they will give a golden rule, but at least we can start to escape from Hindi aggression.</p>
