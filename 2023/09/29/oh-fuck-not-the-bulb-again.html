    <p>I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s happening in my life. The germ of Mind As Labâ€™s idea started in my mind may be when I was in 6<sup>th</sup>, we have been able to place excellent minds into tech Industry since it started operation from 2005. I have worked in Mind As Lab, and have been its observer. Currently, I observe it more. I get consulted for big decisions.</p>

<p>There was this webpage tweaks recently, and I noticed this logo:</p>

<p><img src="https://bafkreiegwxqgtjvt32454bxnwjvdrz7xgg76u4vqpcsegmngxgsz47mmhu.ipfs.nftstorage.link/" alt="" /></p>

<p>Oh, damn I said to me, this was our previous logo, but since itâ€™s a democratic company, the one above won the vote, the one which I saw getting designed:</p>

<p><img src="https://bafybeibgy45edzopr3ncx56o74iowjtuh7cfo3czmxbhb2aqrv5q65vvla.ipfs.dweb.link/mind%20as%20lab%20logo%207.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>got thrown out.</p>

<p>The new logo resembles an electric bulb. What bothers me is I worked for two companies that were obsessed with this bulb thing on there webpage, technologically these companies were junk and were driven by emotions of their leadership and never a scientific process.</p>

<p>The first company was Zanec, look at their webpage:</p>

<p><img src="https://nftstorage.link/ipfs/bafybeiga4l2lpx6zf6qnipqvxg4cb3t63vy2tpedrm6s5ak5wa3umixdxe" alt="" /></p>

<p>It has a bloody bulb. The leadership of this company will never listen to tech and science and they are management kind of people, they need to be selling bottled water like John Sculley to be really successful and never tech.</p>

<p>The next company was Trumatics:</p>

<p><img src="https://nftstorage.link/ipfs/bafybeibrdcg7rphbjrdea3su7cedhcto42horqbwr7um7phca5gb5as7oy" alt="" /></p>

<p>I was Trumatics director for a short period, thankfully I left, and we joke that people picked by Mind As Lab can make more money than Trumatics, and possibly 5 or 6 of them can match and outperform Zanec. But yes, success is never equals technical perfection. Technically perfect person in right environment has higher probability of success. I must also say that I donâ€™t have revenue data of these companies, and I donâ€™t have revenue data of Mind As Lab, itâ€™s just a guess.</p>

<p>Working in these three companies, I can guarantee that a good and honest tech guy can never be successful in Trumatics and Zanec, his chances of success are more probable in Mind As Lab. But yes, since everything changes, I advise the people of Mind As Lab be vigilant and thoughtful so that C-players do not dominate it.</p>

<p>Their tech people are so deprived and mentally drained by the management, Mind As Lab wouldnâ€™t even consider making a deal with them. But yes, Iâ€™m just an observer of Mind As Lab, I can only advise it to make deal with tech companies, and not tech bogus ones. If some management guy becomes leader of Mind As Lab, not even God can save it.</p>

<p>The thing that irks me is, these tech bogus companies have bulb as logo, and so does Mind As Lab (for now), I wish the first company created by me never becomes tech bogus one.</p>
