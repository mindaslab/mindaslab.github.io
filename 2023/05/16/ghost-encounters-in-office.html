    <p>I had two ghost encounters in office till to date.</p>

<p>The first one was in a company called Trumatics. I started it with my friend Umashankar who I met in another company called Zanec. We recruited a girl called Vadivikarasi. In that office I used to take walk in the terrace. Once while I was walking I saw Vadivikarasi leaving office, I thought she was leaving early for some reason. I was 40 feet up, and she was on road. I finished my walk and went downstairs to office and there she was Vadivukkarasi. I was shocked and asked her did she leave office and I said to her, I saw her leaving, she too got terrified. Not wanting to make her more afraid I stopped talking about it.</p>

<p>But what ever left that gate had her dress, backpack like her, skin tone like her, the same hold of cell phone while she browses while she leaves our office. It could be a very strange coincidence that I saw someone else and mistook her, or may be my brain got screwed up.</p>

<p>My second encounter was in a company Francium, there was a devops girl who seemed to know the trade, and we talked a lot. She drove an electric bike, at that time there were almost no electric bikes in India. She sat in my room because she is a one who cannot stay without super chill A/C. One day she left home, after some time a guy called Prasanna got introduced, or we were talking after acquitance after some time (may be few days). Suddenly he said my wife is devops here, before I could say I know and ask about the electric bike he said his wife Archana is inside coding.</p>

<p>My heart stopped, just moments ago I saw his wife leave the office, how can I say to him I saw a ghost which was his wife? This Vadivukkarasi incident popped into my mind. This guy Prasanna asked my why I looked tensed.  Dam hell how can I ever say I saw a ghost which just left office that looked like his wife. I did not react and went in.</p>

<p>Next day I got a doubt and asked others the name of the devops girl that sits in my room, it was Radha they said. Damn, God, dam, life came into me. I am not a peoples person and I get carried away speaking tech to people I donâ€™t even bother asking about their names and stuff.</p>

<p>Finally, I learned these girls names and memorized how they looked so that I donâ€™t get confused. Radha soon quit office and hence from then on if it was devops girl it was Archana. So no more confusion. It was sad seeing a devops engineer who was talented go out.</p>

<p>I learned a lot about the work ethics of Prasanna and Archana, I think Archana left that office before I did, and I was thrown out all of a sudden, and Prasanna quit too. Now I donâ€™t even know if Francium exists. I wonder if any company that letâ€™s go off good talent due to carless planning ever comes up?</p>
