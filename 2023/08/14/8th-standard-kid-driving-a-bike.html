    <p>I was standing in signal where Chennai One meets OMR, my car was just feet or two away from median divider and a small boy possibly 8th standard skillfully drove between my cars right rearview mirror and divider and made a U-turn, when the signal to make a U-turn was not turned on.</p>

<p>Though skilled, I was shocked to see a small boy driving a scooter, I scanned for policeman and none was there, the boy must have been a local who knew well and what he was doing.</p>

<p>I couldnâ€™t stop thinking about this boyâ€™s parents, how irresponsible they are to let a kid drive at such a young age. OMR mostly consists of learned people, I am not saying learned people are intelligent, thatâ€™s different, but learned people donâ€™t make their child do irresponsible things. So to see a boy in OMR shocked me a bit. We can see such kind of behavior in villages where people do not know the law, and donâ€™t care to be responsible parents. There they confuse emotion and responsibility and anything that gives them good emotional feeling is responsible thing for them.</p>

<p>I couldnâ€™t stop thinking what kind of adult this boy will grow up, may be fuck a girl in his 10th standard and become a father? Who knows? He would get bribes and his parents wouldnâ€™t care about it too.</p>

<p>Shouldnâ€™t people who want to have kids know that they should be responsible to the society and should bring up productive and responsible kids needed for society? People are irresponsible and are breeding evil. I wonder what evil he is going to do, and how many are going to be affected by his irresponsible action when he grows up.</p>

<p>Another day I was in my car parked under a tree, early morning in Sithalapakkam, a boy with a juice carton in his left hand, sipping it with a straw controlling his scooter with his right hand drove past my car, stopped before it, drank all the juice, tossed the carton not into dustbin, but on to a bush nearby and drove on.</p>

<p>And here I am expecting India to be a great nation.</p>
