    <p>Talibanâ€™s banned beauty parlors, they burned musical instruments saying that music is evil and corrupts the youth. Aurangzeb, an Islamic ruler in India, did ban arts and music when he ruled. They are the true believers of Islam and almost follow the Quran to the dot. How many true Muslims are there in this world if you count that a person is a Muslim if he only follows Quran exactly, it would be near zero.</p>

<p>I live in India where none of the women in Muslim families I know wear Hijab, they go for job, they are progressive, they marry who ever they please and they donâ€™t face resistance from family, they go to temples, and churches. This is not just in India, this happens in Tunisia, and in lots of African countries where Islam is the primary religion.</p>

<p>Taliban and ISIS were formed to mend that. They want to conquer the whole world and make it pure Islamic, so that we canâ€™t even fly kites for entertainment, we canâ€™t even get medical treatment for our mother, spouse, sister and daughter because Allah want them to suffer and die.</p>

<p>Now Image how long that kind of pure Islam would last? Wonâ€™t human nature of caring for people outshine the words of Allah and get women in our family a medical treatment if they are in pain? Arenâ€™t we brave enough to face eternal hell for caring for our people?</p>

<p>Islam is a joke. People who do believe in Islam do so without analyzing it thoroughly.</p>

<p>Now letâ€™s come to Hinduism, itâ€™s not even a religion, people think itâ€™s a religion because the Brits said so to Indians. Once even Sikhs were classifieds as Hindus, today Lingayat (who are Hinduâ€™s by law) are fighting to have their own religion. So what is Hinduism? It seems to be a set of beliefs that people in the land of India have. There are so many beliefs in India and nothing is fixed. Indiran was worshiped like hell in my state Tamilnad, but now Shivan and Vishnu dominate, and yet these people claim they are the same. The value of morality greatly vary when our God takes avatar. The values for Ram is different from the values of Krishna, the values of Krishna are different from values of Nithyanandha. Each God comes, changes the society for that time and goes off. Yet these people say they follow the same religion.</p>

<p>Change is the only constant in Hinduism, in Islam itâ€™s not. What Quran says is ultimate, and it cannot be changed. This inability for God to change, the inability for their God to send another messenger will make Islam so incompatible and intolerable to modern society, and it should vanish. The current form of Hinduism too will vanish bit Hinduism will last in some form, because Hindus will claim themselves as Hindus no matter however they change.</p>

<p>If in another 500 years, if Jesus is considered son of Hindu God and Mother Mary who is Ammanâ€™s avatar, and Joseph is a mere uncle of Jesus, itâ€™s not surprising. Similarly, I feel Islamist in India will be so different from Arabs they will totally lose their identity. If you feel thatâ€™s a remote possibility think of lord Ganesh, is it and Hindu God?</p>
