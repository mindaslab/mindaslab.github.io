<p>We don’t say Abdul Kalam and Sivathanu Pillai are killers and enemy of humanity if they want to design better lethal missiles, it’s their profession. We do not say if A.R.Rehmaan wants to do a better song than Wakka Wakka, that he wants to make a lot of Indian girls dance seminude, it’s his job to direct sensual and emotional songs. Only Hindu terrorists threatened M.F.Husain and drove him to Qatar, others saw his work as art, I don’t think Madhuri Dixit got offended when he said he wants to draw her nude. To think and produce work of art is his job.</p>

<p>I view Mansoor Ali Khan as a profession villain, it’s his job to do evil roles as possible, so movies look better with him, and hero gets the credit of slaying a very bad guy. No wonder he wants a rape scene with Trisha. He did not say I really want to rape Trisha, that’s bad, but making him look bad is his job, I find no wrong in his speech.</p>

<p>So why I think things have gone bad? Here are the reasons.</p>

<h2 id="genetic-angle">Genetic Angle</h2>

<p>Genetically men are programmed to access many women as possible, that’s how our genes survive. This also means genetically if you block access to a known girl from a guy, then you are successful male. If you have loved a girl, you will know how her brother or dad behaves. Mansoor Ali Khan exhibits no characteristic as alpha male, so slaying him before Trisha will make males near her feel that they are more successful. It’s programmed in our genes, and we will obey it.</p>

<h2 id="netflix-angle">Netflix Angle</h2>

<p>Except for very few, Vijay produces crap movies. He is a good singer and dancer, but he cannot act. Delivering punch dialogs and bravado is not acting, if one needs to know about acting look at Nazaruddin Shah, Irfan Khan and guys like that.</p>

<p>Leo is a movie that only absolutely waste would watch, and if there is a controversy around it, some non-waste people will watch it on OTT, and they might even subscribe to Netflix to see what did happen in the movie. Maybe Netflix sponsored Mansoor to speak like this, or he spoke as a professional, and they pumped money to Trisha to make it controversial, or both, or none of these theories are true.</p>

<h2 id="women-rights-group-wrg-angle">Women Rights Group (WRG) Angle</h2>

<p>These WRG’s, I really don’t know if they help women who are in need, but if there is a beep song (which is perfectly okay in a democracy), or some sensual news, they jump in. Maybe they want to show that they are there and doing something, rather than gobbling up crores of rupees and watch Raki Savanth dance on their personal televisions.</p>

<h2 id="weaker-sex-angle">Weaker Sex Angle</h2>

<p>Definitely we are programmed to support the weaker sex, and we are programmed to support good-looking people, so it’s natural to support Trisha than thinking what could be true, so it’s not surprising much in society support her and villainies Mansoor.</p>
