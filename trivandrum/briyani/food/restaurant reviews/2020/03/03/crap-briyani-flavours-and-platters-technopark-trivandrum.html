<p>There are times when you are sick, you will be offered a awful tasting gruel prepared @ your home. Its tasteless and awful. You would wonder what wrong you had done to deserve such a fate.</p>

<p>Now imagine you are in a restaurant, ordered Briyani and you are offered something that tastes like that awful gruel, tasteless. Its like eating liquid styrofoam, that was my experience today in Flavours and platters in Technopark today.</p>

<p>I went there because one of my friends suggested it to me and he said it will be good. The first thing I found was this restaurant was kind of disorganized. A lady puts a bill for briyani and she keeps it to herself and tells me to goto a counter to collect it. I go to the counter and find a lady laying out a white rice kind of thing on plate, she asks me ‘are you here for briyani?’, I say ‘ya’ and she hands it over to me. I serve myself some pickle and raitha, and another person asks for Briyani, its then she realizes that this briyani is for him, and I hand my plate to him.</p>

<p>Now she goes to the counter and asks if I did order a briyani, the lady at the counter says ‘ya’, this serving lady come back and accuses me (not in a offending way) of not giving the bill. Well the lady in counter would not give me the bill for some reason, all she said was go there.</p>

<p>Then I get a serving of briyani (yak, thats not briyani, its actually white rice, two pieces of chicken meat and a boiled egg). Usually Kerala Briyani is not as good ad Hydrabadi, but it would have enough masala to mix into the rice and make it spicy. Here no, the masala was almost non existant. You just had white rice, boiled two pieces of chicken tossed into it along with an egg. All these stuff when sold for Rs 20/- might be okay, but they are charging it whoppy Rs 160/-. Thats an absolute waste.</p>

<p>My friend back at office told me that once Malabar briyani @ Flavours and Platters was good, but now I feel its truly crap.</p>
