    <p>In one of my blogs I had slammed flavors and platters for their briyani, and ya, briyani over there is pathetic. I must however say that their tiffin is good, or should I say okay enough.</p>

<p>Before I was in Bhavani and went to Taste 6 because my friends recommended it. Then my location was shifted to Pamba and Flavors and Platters was the nearest thing I had.</p>

<p>I had purchased poori. In both Taste 6 and Flavors and Platters we get three poori’s. But here comes the difference, in taste 6 the poori looks larger and thinner, in flavors the poori looks bit small and I feel its more bulky.</p>

<p>In Taste 6 the poori when torn get crumbly and flakes off, in Falvors its not like that. Poori is a poori and you would feel the top layer of the poori is bit crunchy, the bottom layer is soft a nicely cooked. So Flavors wins.</p>

<p>In Taste 6 we get a white coconut chutney, a spicy orange coconut chutney, and potato curry. But the quantity of side dish in Taste 6 is very small. In flavors we just get potato curry, and it tastes okayish to good sometimes, but they have a nice shallow side dish plate with a handle. In case you have a hot side dish that handle will help you and if the side dish is liquidy you can turn the plate into a huge ladel and pour it onto your main plate. Crockery of Flavors is exceptional compared to other restaurants in Technopark. This side dish plate is half filled with porato curry and its copious, that won my heart.</p>

<p>The ambiance of Flavors and Platters is good. The poori in Flavors costs Rs 50/- whereas in Taste 6 costs Rs 52/-. I wish Taste 6 either reduces their price or improves their quality.</p>

<p>Today I ate parota and Egg Masla in Flavours and it was good too. I loved the smell of burnt onions, some people outside India may not like it.</p>

<p>In one sentence, Flavors is not for Briyani, but its good for tiffin.</p>
