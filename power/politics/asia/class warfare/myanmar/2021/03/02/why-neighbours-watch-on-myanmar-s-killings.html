<p>I tuned into Al-Jazeera today and predictably the military Junta in Myanmar has started to fire live ammunition into the crowds. My initial instinct was Myanmar is our sister nation, we share more history and culture with it. Its writing looks like more of old Tamil, Telugu and Kannada as they were developed curved representations so that it could be written on palm  leaves without tearing it. Myanmar is a Buddhist nation, a religion thats purely Indo-Napalese, but what’s Nepal without India? They are 100% our blood. But its neighbours are mute. Only Indonesia is trying to rake up the issue.</p>

<p>People might say don’t get involved in politics, stay safe, but it because of evil minds and bad politics, lives are lost in Myanmar. For people of a country to prosper, it’s not just that country, even its neighbours should be right. Unfortunately Myanmar has got wrong neighbours.</p>

<p>In fact if people of Myanmar were okay for military intervention by its neighbours, then Indian and Bangladeshi artillery should be firing, troops should be amassing on Myanmar while Indian missiles streak in and strike their military targets thus weakening them and giving the people an upper hand. Yet we act as though people of our blood when killed it doesn’t matter. Why so?</p>

<p>Its funny. Bangladesh was born because the will of people there was oppressed by Pakistan so much that people started to pour into India. And having limited resources and India being starving nation then, we had to fix it. We simply can’t keep feeding people thrown out by our neighbour, so we indulged in war, defeated Pakistan, and may be we were paid damages thus offsetting loss. Yes war is Economics, don’t mistake it. Ever wonder why the world watches 1000’s killed in Africa today? There is no money there. None will thank, plead guilty and pay you if you conquer that hell infested land.</p>

<p>Okay coming back to Bangladesh. Today its just the opposite. We have got Bengali government that has enacted  Digital Security Act (DSA), arrested people and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/world/asia/bangladesh-mushtaq-ahmed-dead.html">one prominent guy even died in custody for a facebook post</a>. Mushtaq Ahmed is his name. Bengalis are rising up against the government and government needs to quell them. Now this situation is like very similar to Myanmar.</p>

<p>So think, the Bengali government wants to silence its own people, now how can it say to Myanmar that please let freedom of public opinion in your nation while I silence my people with DSA?</p>

<p>Should I talk about India? Oh God! This Modi. All of a sudden farm bills are brought into force without discussion in parliament. PubG and TikTok are ban with claims that they will hurt Chinese economy, thats the intelligence this government has. Now all of a sudden there is law, once gain without discussion in parliament on OTT platform regulation. When people revolted against polluting Vedanta copper plants in Thuthukudi, they were shot and killed like dogs and neither Modi or Edapaadi Palanisamy has been hung for it. Protesting farmers are ignored, the PM won’t speak with them. This government is experimenting all ways to undermine democracy.</p>

<p>Why on Earth India under such a dictator would even want to raise a hair against Myanmar? In fact Modi and his team will be observing taking notes from the Junta so that BJP can gain absolute power here in India.</p>

<p>Thailand though its Priminister is elected democratically, none can touch its monarchy. They can do what they want and none can question them. Unfortunately people of Myanmar are part of 10,000+ year old east Asian culture where there are classes. the class of Kings, the class of Bosses, the class of Workers, the lower classes cannot question the upper ones, it’s a huge taboo.</p>

<p>In fact if I visit Thailand, I could get a life term just for writing these words. That’s how worst Thailand is. Do you think Thailand will raise its voice against similar minded oppressive Junta?</p>

<p>We the people of India should not forget that Myanmar is facing these huge problems and its people are left helpless because non democratic nature of countries surrounding it. First we as Indians should try to make our country more democratic so that our neighbours become democratic too, and help will arrive if one day we too are oppressed by Modi, Amit Shah or the Gandhis or who ever.</p>

<p>Remember this is not just Myanmar’s problem. This is a class war between people who think who can control public and public who think they should be having voice. This war is taking place in the deepest regions of Africa, in the companies I worked, and in the glittering place called USA. There is always and oppressor and oppressed. The oppressor is always afraid of free speech, alternate opinion and truth leaking out. I hope humans are smart enough to break open it. I hope people around the world start seeing this as a local problem in many places and unite to fight the oppressors who oppress us and the oppressor within us which wants to conquer the Universe and become The God.</p>
