    <p>Yestarday I was in Yaa Mahaideen in Perumbaakkam. We bought some khushka to eat and side dishes. One was Chicken 65 and other was Hydrabadi mutton gravy.</p>

<p>The khushka arrived promptly, and later I found out that it was mutton khushka and not chicken, thats great, but at the hotel we were irritated to our limit. Once the khuska was given as parcel to us, the guy told us to go outside and show the bill and get the side dish parcel, so we went out.</p>

<p>There was a small counter outside and there was all these Zomato and Uber guys. It was chaotic. Our token number was 70 and only token 29 was done with. We waited for 30 mins and our token wasnâ€™t called.</p>

<p>I took the bill and went inside and aked the billing guy to refund the side dish money and to my horror he would say he wouldnâ€™t. What? They will make us wait, they wonâ€™t tell us any information about our order, we have to keep standing for so long and if we want to cancel our order they wonâ€™t do it. Is that a way to treat a customer?</p>

<p>The billing guy said that our side dish was cooked and has been rushed to the counter just now. So we ran out to get it, the guy at the disposing counter said the billing guys knows nothing. We had to endue such pillar to post running. It took a great deal of protest from me and after nearly 1 hour they said they has lost our bill, took the copy we had and delivered our side dish.</p>

<p>Its not just me, as soon as I entered the restaurant, a customer was shouting at the waiter, he ordered a briyani, he was unable to eat it and hence wanted a lemon juice to go along with it. It never arrived. He shouted and and canceled it. The juice arrived 10 minutes later, that too when that guy had struggled and had almost finished with the briyani. He was really pissed off.</p>

<p>To deliver briyani Yaa Mohaideen is great, but for other things their cooking and delivery chain is broken. A Uber or Zomato guy there said he had been waiting for nearly 1 hour for side dish.</p>

<p>One thing I would suggest is to buy briyani there and order side dish from from places around it. There are other restaurants in the same block and they sell tandoori and other side dish stuff.</p>

<p>Finally lets come to the taste. At home the khushka was okay, the hydrabadi mutton gravy was good, but the chicken 65 tasted like cardboard. It had almost no marination and was hard.</p>

<p>I think Yaa Mohaideen is like Apple, a brand whoâ€™s name is well established, highly priced and not really worth it. My suggestion is to try other small genuine briyani shops.</p>
