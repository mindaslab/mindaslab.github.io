    <p>This hotel in Supriya, that fucking Andhra mess sucks. Really sucks. Me and my friends went there to eat briyani, the briyani over there comes in the form of a kushka, for both mutton and chicken briyani you get the same kushka. If you order mutton briyani, they give kushka with mutton gravy, if you order chicken briyani, they give kushka with chicken gravy.</p>

<p>The chicken gravy was okay, but the mutton gravy was hot to taste. For a person like me its okay, but for my friends it was too much and they struggled with it.</p>

<p>We ordered two kushkas and mutton and chicken gravy. I was okay about this arrangement, but for many in Tamilnadu it would be like, you goto a tea shop and order tea, the vendor gives you a donkey, sugarcane, rights to a gas field, right to mine iron etc… You need to milk the donkey, extract sugar from sugar cane, mine iron and make cylinders and stove, from the gas field you need to extract gas, liquify it and put it in cylinder and finally make tea. But for me that’s okay, for me its like having briyani with multiple flavours at once.</p>

<p>The only side dish they offer is raitha, that is chopped onions in diluted butter milk, so diluted in fact you feel its for a drink than a raitha. You kinda need to hunt for onions in it. We also ordered extra rice, and to our surprise it came with a cost too. Most Andhra mess, and Madurai mess offer rice as compliment with briyani, over here it costs.</p>

<p>The thing I don’t like is stinginess of the hotel, I was burning hot eating the briyani, or to say chilli mutton rice mix, for the extra plain rice I reached for moore kulambu in next table, the fucking hotel owner / manager stopped me saying that moore kulambu is only for meals. It really hurt me. As my friend outside the hotel remarked, we eat for Rs 500/- and this guy won’t spare Rs 5/- worth of moore kulambu.</p>

<p>Compared to Tamil hotels which are stingy, Andhra hotels offer bountiful food, in some Andhra hotels I have emptied a mini bucket full of pakodas because it was so tasty, I have seen these Andhra guys enjoy watch people eating their food than like Tamil’s who worry about the customer consuming his profit margin, but here, Supriya has been Tamilianized,  they are no more an Andhra mess which we all love.</p>

<p>Then back at office, we all did not feel well, I got a mild stomach upset, so I do doubt about the hotel’s hygiene. Lack of hygiene and lack of the hospitality of these Andhra people make me feel bad.</p>

<p>A few days later another friend of mine ate meals over there and got stomach upset too. So….. You think abut it.</p>
