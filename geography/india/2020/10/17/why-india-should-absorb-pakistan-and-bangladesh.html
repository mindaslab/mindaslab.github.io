    <p>Why did we elect Modi as our priminister? We did not like Manmohan Singh (even though heâ€™s a genius,) to listen to a woman of Italian origin. We have just got freedom from Brits who donâ€™t even wash their bottoms yet, and now we have to listen to a lady who is from a similar culture. We were fed up with 2G, and other scams that plagued our nation. For people like me, if Modi came to power he would not hesitate to kill Pakistanis and integrate that state with us. He is a person who watched genocide of Muslims in his own state and feels unrepentant, I thought he would not hesitate to put an end to Pakistan.</p>

<p>History needs Hitler like and devils. If itâ€™s not for Winston Churchill who killed millions in India by shipping grains to Europe, England would have not won the second world war. If India needs a bloody war with Pakistan to wipe them off so that our territorial integrity is maintained, and so be it. Congress wonâ€™t do it, so we put a Satan in power. But this Satan is killing our own people who are Muslims and other lower castes in Hinduism, than killing Pakistanis and thus bringing relief to Iran, Afghanistan and us.</p>

<p>Today I saw this map of India:</p>

<p><img src="/images/indian_subcontinent.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Look how well our territory is defined by mountains in North, East and West, and ocean at the bottom. And why we canâ€™t rule this tiny land fully? Because some fucker 10,000 years ago said a God called Shiva exists? Because another fucker 1000 years ago said a God called Allah exist? Science says both are untrue! If we listen to some word of mouth things without verifying the facts how stupid we are? We must think about it.</p>

<p>Even today I think Persians and Afghanistanâ€™s refer Pakistanis as Hinduâ€™s. We are the people of Indus, the mighty river that fed and watered our forefathers before all this Muhammad and this Saffron saints existed. We had an really efficient cities, drains, brick making and industrial skills. Still the iron pillars erected by Ashoka  hasnâ€™t rusted, Qutub Minar needs regular tending to keep it upright. That was the level of sophistication we had achieved eons ago. A might civilization was spread from Boluchistan to Tamilnadu. In fact Dravidian Civilization was spread from Iran to Srilanka eons before Ashoka ruled. We are one people, and we have lost it all because few idiots point out to few texts and say that we are different people. What a bullshit!</p>

<p>Just like the United Kingdom, European Union and United States, we must form a united India that consists of Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Srilanka and Burma We may have different parliaments, governments and cultures but we can have common things like defense, space program, scientific endeavor. There will be no borders among these states, people could travel freely without restrictions, a common currency would mean a better commerce.</p>

<p>But ya, dream is a dream, foolish humans are foolish humans.</p>
