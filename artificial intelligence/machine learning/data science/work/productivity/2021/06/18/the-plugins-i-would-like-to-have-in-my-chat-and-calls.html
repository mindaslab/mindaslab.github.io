<p>I am a software developer. Somehow lazy guys seem to dominate this field, and I am lazy. Despite being in this field for nearly 20 years, I do not understand why we have so much meetings. Till this day I do not understand what most people in my meetings talk, but I have to be there. I have no doubt this is the fate of many software developers and office goers out there.</p>

<p>Having said that, and knowing that our life revolves around chat and calls, it would be nice if we have the following plugins in our chat and calling programs to ease life.</p>

<p><strong>Fake my text plugin</strong></p>

<p>Okay this is text based plugin that chat’s with your colleagues on channels like Slack and Teams so that they think you are there. When it cannot chat and finds that its beyond its capacity to handle, only then you get a notification to interfere. When ever you interfere, the algorithm learns and becomes better and handles similar situation well the next time.</p>

<p>As a software developer I need to concentrate hard, and all of a sudden I get a <em>Hey</em> and <em>Hi</em> in my chat that just breaks down the thought data structure I had built up in my brain, and its annoying. This plugin will save me lot of time and make me lot productive.</p>

<p><strong>Dress me up plugin</strong></p>

     </div>

<p>I live in Chennai, a hot place. I wear a light dress, and for meetings I switch dresses so that I look professional. Long ago there was a mobile app which you can point at any one and it will show them naked real time, the A.I algorithm will undress them and show to you. Why can’t we have an algorithms that does the reverse where it dresses one up. No matter what ever I wear or not wear, this will dress me up and show like I am a pro. This will save lot of world’s time, won’t it?</p>

<p><strong>Fake me plugin</strong></p>

<p>This is the ultimate plugin that will fake you entirely so that there is no need for you to be in front of the cam. May be it would also talk for you and be your replacement virtually. May be that’s in far future. For now, your zoom could be hooked up to your earpods where you will talk, and this plugin will fake your camera feed and make you appear real to others while you take a stroll in the park listening to meeting and talking.</p>

<p><strong>Brief me up plugin</strong></p>

<p>Most of the meeting time one does not talk, one does listen to a boring talker, thats utter waste of time. Given that humans are poor communicators, it would be nice if there is a plugin that would prepare a highlight video feed or few lines of text which summarizes the entire meeting. This would save us lot of time.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The world of artificial intelligence has excellent applications to be cracked. Jump in! May be <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neural Link</a> will make humanity just one brain and eliminate all meetings.</p>
