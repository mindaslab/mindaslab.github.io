<p>I just told on the Internet that my ruby book has a permanent webpage here <a href="https://mindaslab.github.io/I-Love-Ruby/">https://mindaslab.github.io/I-Love-Ruby/</a> and to my suprise I had more than 550 visitors less than 2 days. Thats a lot for programming book.</p>

<p><img src="/images/600_views.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Yes the book is a good one, you will know when you visit “What people say” section. Many people have given good reviews about it. I did have bad reviews from people, but soon found out they were bogus except for one or two who pointed out some grammatical mistakes. I was affected by lot of prejudice too.</p>

<p>Overall I am happy, a language thats made me food, given me shelter and clothing for some time is made easy to understand by me. I wanted to say how my book smashed things.</p>

<p><strong>Its free</strong></p>

<p>My book is free 100%. Free in material, as you can download it free from Github.</p>

<p>Its also free by soul. Its been copyrighted under GNU free documentation license (GFDL) so that all humanity can use it without restrictions.</p>

<p><strong>Not restricted by publisher</strong></p>

<p>If I went to a publisher, I would have had lot of restrictions. People would have told this and that and I would have given up. Without publisher, I had no deadline. The first books of I Love Ruby had very less content, but then editions started to appear, sometimes even more than one edition per day. Today this has got a term now, they call rolling release. This lack of management and the ability to write when I want to write may have brought out the best in me.</p>

<h1 id="looking-for-sponsors">Looking for sponsors</h1>

<p>I am looking for Ruby related companies to sponsor my work. If you like to please contact me. I am wishing to spend my time writing books so that people can understand technology better, become a better technician and earn with a smile. Sponsoring won’t be easy as I am not willing to give up my sovereignty for money. But if you think Ruby has made your life better for you and your office you might consider to sponsor.</p>
