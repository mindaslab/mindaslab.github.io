<p>Recently a bunch of people from Coimbatore became acquittance with me and they
became important people in my life. I have had many problems with people from that region
in my past. I am a Agile project manager and very open and jovial. Living
in Tamilnadu, a place where there are lot of Coimbatore people, I had to manage
them.</p>

<p>I have found that its those people who fall off from my team often. They are dull,
don’t speak much and I feel their life is non-colorful and they have no taste and
passion for Computer technology. It would look like they have learned
computer science in a dream to get rich rather than for the love of it. Its very
similar like two people in thirties getting married because they are getting
aged quickly rather than they have really felt one another’s love.</p>

<p>When this Coimbatore bunch became known to me, I had forgotten the lesson what
I had learned from them, possibly ignored it for my convenience and things struck
one day.</p>

<p>It was an invitation to a function in Banglore that they wanted to attend with me.
I was certain I will not be able to find tickets on a train and since bus travel
will be tiring and aircraft ridiculously expensive when booked short I said no.</p>

<p>Time passed. One person in that gang, I still don’t know what happened to him,
possibly he was drunk, God knows, called me one day,  just a few days before the function was about
to happen. He said that he will not attend the function if I do not attend it. I
was confused. That guy kept repeating the same thing again and again despite me
refusing it repeatedly. In a haste to end the conversation I said I will attend.
I honestly thought that’s the end of it.</p>

<p>This first thing made me wonder. Lets say that I am in a hotel with a friend of
mine, I order poori and friend orders rava dosai. Even though that person is a
friend of mine, will it be okay if I insist that I will eat poori only if my
friend orders it too? Shouldn’t one respect others privacy and choice? Here is the
second one…</p>

<p>Then that guy (, possibly more pegs must have gone in by now) said I must make sure
another senior person too must attend the function. I said tickets are not
available on train and it was verified by some travel agent who made a living by
booking train tickets. But that guy went on. ‘There are four trains available, you
must get tickets’. Like a tape recorder he repeated this too despite me telling
him again and again the facts.</p>

<p>I seriously had no idea what happened to that person and began to worry. His opinion
about me counts. I really thought something happened to him, the drunk theory did
not cross my mind then.</p>

<p>I told a person very close to them, and asked if they had influenced this guy to
speak like this. For some reason it became a serious issue and this Coimbatore gang
thinks bad of me. All I was really doing at that time was ending my day, wishing
for good sleep and thinking about my company and felling grateful to what I had.</p>

<p>Its strange what rules people have. I was invited for a Hindu function. Hindus
in India can have very strange beliefs and rules and you can see here in
<a href="/2017/07/21/strange-hindu-rules.html">Strange Hindu Rules</a>. Some how other
Coimbatore people don’t find that person crazy, but they don’t wish to speak
about this incident any more. People even say that this is showing respect in Coimbatore style.
Well, then this is the strangest piece of thing I have ever encountered in my
life.</p>
