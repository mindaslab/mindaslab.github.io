<p>Last Thursday, on 10th, I took my car out for my office, right at Sithapakkam junction @ Mambakkam road / checkpost, I saw the concrete diver was smashed into pieces. Something from Ponmaar was going towards Medavakkam when it seems to have smashed into the divider. I later learned that a water tanker smashed. It was said that as the tanker crashed, it climbed up the divider, I was able to notice the ascent in the divider.</p>

<p>I also heard that a Ritz car driven by some college guys traveling from Medvakkam towards Sithalapakkam smashed head on at the divider before Gold winner oil company. I also heard that couples, old people apparently, Standing in Amman Kovil or Valluvar nagar bus stop in Sithalapakkam were hit by an yellow board vehicle and they both died, the vehicle ran away.</p>

<p>All these things have happened literally just few stone throws away from my home, it makes me wonder what the local councilor, traffic police, the transport minister and Tamilnadu government is doing? I also admire at the efficiency of the bureaucracy, all these things have not appeared in main stream news channels. How these incidents have been efficiently hushed up? Or is media in Tamilnadu is just sleeping? I have no idea.</p>

<p>While driving back home from office at about 7:30 PM on the same 10th, the traffic was badly blocked, a van had hit the divider in front of Ramarao body works. I had witnessed evidence of an accident and another fresh accident happened just minutes before on the same day. The driver in the van hadn’t got out, the crumple zone before him was crumpled and his side of windshield bore a crack. The van was going towards Medavakkam.</p>

<p>The politicians go door to door distributing money, bags of free rice and other goodies during election time, but they fail to put lamps on Medavakkam to Mambakkam road. Its really dark, we locals know which roads turns where, new one won’t as the roads badly turn at wrong places. There are speed breakers and numerous potholes here and there which new people won’t know. They could stick enough reflective stickers on those concrete dividers rather than erecting posters bearing their ugly looking faces on corner here and there. Around Medavakkam to Mambakkam road, there are three liquor shops, wonder if these are contributing to accidents? The police seem to stop goods lorries, water tankers and other merchant vehicles for inspection, but never I have seen in my neighborhood any one been stopped for drunk driving even though with an very untrained eye I have seen many people drive erratically around my neighborhood.</p>

<p>I wish Sithalapakkam people were not stupid either, till today they seemed to have succumbed to the fores of bribes from politicians. I wish people think before they vote so that the neighborhood would become a better place.</p>
