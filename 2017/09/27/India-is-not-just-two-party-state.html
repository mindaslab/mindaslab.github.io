<p>One of my friends tweeted this</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If not modi who else, Shall we bring back Manmohan?.

<p>It was response to this tweet</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Should Narendra Modi continue as Prime minister of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/India?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#India</a>? | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Politics?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Politics</a></p>&mdash; Karthikeyan A K (@karthik_ak) <a href="https://twitter.com/karthik_ak/status/912956326598213633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I asked blunt to twitter users weather Narendramodi should continue as Indian P.M
or not? Its right for a person to vote, its right for a person to change his
choice of vote to any candidate or to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None_of_the_above">NOTA</a>
at any time I feel.</p>

<p>Many people think about instability. What will happen if one can vote again and
again, possibly multiple times a day? Won’t governments change just like that? Yes it
will. But isn’t a job of citizen of a democracy to be educated and not bring
instability in a nation? Or does a person think its the duty of the government to
force stability in a land that it rules? Which do you think is right?</p>

<p>People seem to be having wrong notion, they feel people or nation can decide
better if we had limited choices. People feel like there must be a one major
ruling party and one minor ruling party, they must keep the nation stable.</p>

<p>I respect their thought. I respect them choosing not to have choice, but now
take the case of India, my nation. We have two major parties, one is Congress
which is ultra corrupt and another one is relatively less corrupt or good at
hiding corruption, its called as Bharathiya Janatha Party.</p>

<p>Lets say that I am a Biz tycoon dealing with billions of dollars a month. How
long it would take for me bribe leadership of these two parties? No matter who
comes to power, since I control the money I control the law, the flow of
information and hence citizens of my nation will think I am good guy all the time
unless a miracle happens. One or two might find out what I do, but its easy to
eliminate or silence them.</p>

<p>Now lets see how dynamic democracy works and how it will make politicians
tremble. In dynamic democracy any one can vote any time, or the voting time
period is reduced shortly, say 10 days (I wish it could be 10 minutes). You can
cast your vote once in every 10 days and it will be anonymous. Lets say that
10,000 people vote in a village, say if
there is more than 6000 votes registered in past 10 days, then the system will
count the votes, who ever has majority will be elected and dismissal order will
be sent to the person who was on power and if he had lost. Things will be
automated.</p>

<p>Dynamic democracy requires two steps, two very independent thing. There will be
voting Kisoks all over the country. It will have two independent systems. The
first is an access system. It will take in your biometric and check if you
unlocked the system in past 10 days. If the system was not unlocked it will
order the voting software to take charge. The voting software doesn’t know who
you are, it will simply list the candidate and record a vote. Thats it.</p>

<p>The access control software and the voting software shares no data. In fact the
voting can be recorded and shred in block chain to make it really transparent. Knowing
that one can be evaluated every 10 days will put shivers on politicians spine,
will make them obey to people quick rather than to dodge them in a hope that
they will forget it during the next voting season.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-happen-because-of-dynamic-democracy">What will happen because of Dynamic Democracy?</h2>

<p>Dynamic democracy is not just voting reform, it should also be the way one
stands for election. One should be able to stand as candidate in a place just by clicking
few buttons in an app. Why do you think one need to pay the sate or follow
formalities for one to be elected? That looks stupid to me.</p>

<p>So any person having the right idea should be able to become candidate,
challenge the incumbent in an instant. This way we will have richness, and not just people
sticking to two parties. We must not go by party politics, instead we must go 
by idea politics and elect
people who align with our ideas and are passionate about it.</p>

<p>I see no different between parties and cults. I wish people who rule us be
independent thinkers and free souls.</p>
