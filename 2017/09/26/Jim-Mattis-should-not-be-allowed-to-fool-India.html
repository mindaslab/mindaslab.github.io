<p>One thing has happened because the Congress leadership is ultra stupid, we have
a government made up of stupids at he center (stupids have won over ultra
stupid ones). Since stupids have ruled us long, the USA is simply using us as
their Colony so that it citizens could be merry, just like the repeat 70 years
ago when the British exploited us.</p>

<p>India should think about India and Indians. We must think about ways to make
ourselves better and place trust in Science, Technology, Philosophy, Reasoning
and Logic. No matter how hard that Jim Mattis (visiting US diplomat) pushes,
we must not intervene in Afganistan militarily. It would be destructive to us.</p>

<p>We have already invested a lot in Afganistan and haven’t got anything in return
yet. Afganistan is failure of USA’s foreign policy. Any country that had
relation with United Kingdom and USA has some kind of problem, Afganistan is one
among them.</p>

<p>If Afgan’s or USA wishes to give us money in advance, what can India do is to
sell its weapons to the Afgan army, we can train their military as our military
is one of the best disciplined in the world. We can repair Afghan defense and
offense installations.</p>

<p>Its not a great situation to see the Taliban occupying 47% of Afganistan, but
this is what you will get if you have religion preside over logic and
administration. Afgans will never realize it. They might fight hundreds of
battles to get foreigners out of their land, but they are too afraid to fight
a battle to keep religion out of state affairs. They are simply doomed if no
miracle happens.</p>

<p>Our operations should be in Pakistan, we must weaken it by a million cuts.
India should not go behind the Pakistan’s military, ISIS and terrorists as they
are doing a good job of getting the county plunging into abyss, but India must
target liberation of Boluchistan. With war on western and Eastern front,
Pakistan will have difficult time to concentrate on pumping terrorist into
Kashmir.</p>

<p>All I am saying is this, its not the fate of Indian soldier to die on someone
else’s soil, lets use this situation to test our weapons, technology progress
and political theory.</p>

<p>Wonder how many Indian politicians are corrupt and will let USA treat us as
another colony? We must wait and see.</p>
