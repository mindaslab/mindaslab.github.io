<p>If they don’t, then why people use Jira? Well, Information Technology industry
is more about deception than real science and software, and Jira is much needed
by management folks for deceiving their client, so they use it.</p>

<p><strong>Jira has done lot of brand building</strong></p>

<p>First, Jira has done lot of brand building, it has made people to believe using
it will make things cool ad people have some how believe it. Some how none who
bat for Jira can publish a scientific study that Jira has improved their
efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Jira is a jargon</strong></p>

<p>Most of clients are ignorant, you tell them that you are using big data with
blockchain and everything is managed by Jira where he can know the status of
the project at his finger tip, then he would succumb to the jargon and think you
are great and you really know stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Jira introduces inefficiency</strong></p>

<p>Clients and management like to see their team sweat out even if things are
really easy. Trust me, I am a programmer for 15 years and I have seen how people
make simple things complex and make you go mad.</p>

<p>Jira introduces inefficiency into project, it makes the project difficult to
manage and you need managers to do it. This creates fake jobs, plus having a
manager means the company can bill the client more.</p>

<p><strong>Atlassian needs to survive</strong></p>

<p>Atlassian is one big corporate mess of fat ass bosses who needs to feed like
pigs, go on to Italian holidays, stay in star hotels and claim that they have
changed the world for good by introducing Jira, if you don’t use them
they have to make a living by cheating the world in another way. So please trust
and use Jira without questioning.</p>

<p>Stay happy living like a goat as ignorance is bliss.</p>
