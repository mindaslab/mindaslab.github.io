<p>Medium is popular blogging platform, but I moved away from  it to Jekyll and
Jekyll was good. Let me tell you why I don’t like to blog any more on medium.</p>

<p><strong>Medium wants to track you</strong></p>

<p>Medium loves to track you. It wants to know what your interests are? What you
like to read? Who you follow? Are people working in Medium your friends to know
these details about you?</p>

<p>Though medium does not force you to login, look at this ugly tool bar at the
bottom</p>

<p><img src="/assets/messing_up_as_developer.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Medium reduces your reading area, it forces you to sign in to read so that it
knows about you.</p>

<p><strong>You don’t know what they do with your data</strong></p>

<p>Do you really know what Medium does with your data and the behavioral data
they collect from you? Do they sell it to others? Share it to NSA? Who knows?
This is the major problem we face today using software as service platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Anonymous commenting not possible</strong></p>

<p>Even to comment on ones blog, one needs to login to medium and have a medium
account. Thats ridiculous. Commenting means you have more interest on that
particular topic, so you can be sold more ads about it. Thats why they want you
to login so that they can track about you.</p>

<p><strong>Blog migration is hard</strong></p>

<p>Migrating your blog content away from Medium is hard. Unlike Wordpress you do
not have a good migration tool or a tool where you can download all your data.</p>

<p><strong>What happens if you delete your blog?</strong></p>

<p>In medium, none know what happens if you delete your blog or account.
Does it really get deleted? Your details are kept by them even if you have
deleted your account? Who knows what they are doing without your knowledge?</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>All these questions have made me to log off medium, I wish you too do the same.
Its far far better to have your own server, possibly a wordpress one and blog
with it.</p>
