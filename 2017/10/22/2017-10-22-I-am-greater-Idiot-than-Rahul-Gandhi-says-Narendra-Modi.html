<p>We all know that the Nehru family consists of a bunch of idiots. The fact how
Nehru was merciful with China even thought they were invading us in ‘62, the
fact how disillusioned that Indira Gandhi became and brought in emergency
rule, the fact how Rajiv Gandhi kept mum when Bofors was going on, the 
fact how he watched murder of Sikhs after his moms death, the fact how
Sonia and Rahul Gandhi watched the 2G scam when UPA was in power are proof
to their stupidity and shows inability of them being a leader.</p>

<p>Perhaps being stupid is in the genes of Nehrus, but there is another stupid on
the rise, this stupid once said that India was once great in biotechnology,
hence it was able to operate a boy, remove his head and put the head of an
elephant and called him Pillayaar. This great idiot is Narendra Modi. I think
he said this in IISC in front of scientists who must have got heart attack
after hearing this.</p>

<p>Indians are so idiot that this guy enjoyed and still enjoys popularity wave in
India. Now once again in his speech his idiotness shines. I was shocked to hear
recently a speech where Modi was disowning GST. We all are now sure that GST
though a good idea was a failure in the way it was implemented. Just like
demonetization it was a good idea but waste in implementation. GST means tax
will become simpler. Many countries have a uniform tax, say you selling an Audi,
you charge 7% tax, say you are selling a pack of cigarettes, the tax is still 7%.
Though the GST has avoided multiple taxation (by state and center), the
implementers were stupid enough to have various tax categories.</p>

<p>Temples and religious institutions have no tax at all I reckon even though they
cheat people saying that a thing called god exists, but alcohol which too messes
up with mind is taxed nearly 200%. Why? Because this is what will happen if
we are idiots enough to think these idiots are intelligent and vote them
into power.</p>

<p>When GST was launched, Modi’s name was on it every where, many in BJP said
it was essential and great move. The idea of uniform tax is great, but the
implementation? And suddenly when there are state elections, GST rate changes.
Damn these fools. Confused, the accounting system in nation is in shambles and
none knows how to fix it. Its like Indian re-living the days of Muhammad Bin
Tuglak. Now seeing that things have gone worse, Modi is trying to distance
himself from the spoils of his governance.</p>

<p>Is this the way a true leader behaves? Shouldn’t a leader have the guts to come
out say ‘Yes I have made a mistake, I am sorry, and these are the ways I am
planning to fix it’. Isn’t that a mark of a good leader? Why on Earth Modi
who wants to project himself as a strong man is behaving like a rat and making
fool of himself?</p>
