<p>It was something better than facebook and twitter. It was something useful. I was
coding a website that did not throw junk and shit your friends post, but that could
be very useful to the human race and it looks like no one has done it before.</p>

<p>I was coding a website named <a href="http://formulapot.com">Formula Pot</a>. Its possibly 
the worlds only formula sharing website, where one can post formulations and review
formulations posted by others. Every bit in the website was designed to be useful
for humanity.</p>

<p>To attract people to that website I set up an Diaspora account</p>
