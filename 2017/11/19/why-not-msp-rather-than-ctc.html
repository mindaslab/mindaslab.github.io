<p>Your company cares about you. It has given you the opportunity to succeed right?
And they make your life better and simple right? Okay in that case why don’t
your I.T company say that this is the Minimum Salary Paid (MSP) paid to you
rather than you are a Cost To The Company (CTC)?</p>

<p>Well, why am I proposing this. Its simple. CTC is a degrading term. It means that 
you are costing that company, possibly not worth it. Well, that what it really means.
You are an liability rather than an asset. Customer brings in money and
magically it turns into profit, and you bite away those profits being an cost to
and rather not an asset to the company.</p>

<p>Companies that truly care about people should not advertise that if you are
employed and it costs the company so much, saying that you cost a bite out of
their fortune, rather they must praise your worth. Companies must say that you
are worth so much, so this is the minimum salary that we can pay you. That means
at the end of working for that year your account will have that much amount
credited by the company. And that is a minimum amount. It can go up and not down.
This means that your minimum worth is so much and maximum is yet to be explored!</p>

<p>Wouldn’t that be nice?</p>
