<p>I just conducted a poll on twitter and it wasn’t astonishing that most people
feel that the government wasn’t prepared for it. Whats astonishing for me was
22% felt that government was prepared for it! Thats a huge number infact. If
these are the people who are going to vote for AIADMK like fanatics, who knows
it would come to power once again.</p>

<p>Another poll was about IT companies in Chennai. IT companies are worst managed
things. They are extremely inefficient piece of management, thats because we get
cheap labor in Chennai and hence they can be abused a lot. In fact slaves in
ancient Rome were able to work for just 6 hours and were able to get away and
they had 4 months of holiday! But we are forced to work so much.</p>

<p>This was the poll I conducted:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Did your IT company in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/chennai?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#chennai</a> made Saturday working because of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChennaiRains2017?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ChennaiRains2017</a> ?</p>&mdash; Karthikeyan A K (@karthik_ak) <a href="https://twitter.com/karthik_ak/status/926495453645901824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>and not surprisingly looks like 50% of IT companies are inefficient and force
their employees to work on Saturday because of the rain.</p>

<p>And here is a food for thought, we the people of Chennai too pay taxes like
people in Tokyo:</p>
