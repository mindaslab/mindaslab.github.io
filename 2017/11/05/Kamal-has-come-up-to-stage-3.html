<p>There are 4 stages in winning a battle against bad people:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First they ignore you.</li>
  <li>Then they laugh at you.</li>
  <li>Then they fight you.</li>
  <li>Then you win.</li>
</ol>

<p>To enter politics, especially in Tamilnadu and then to win will take a long time,
no matter who ever it is, Kamaraj, Annadurai, and other looters, they took lot
of time and mentoring and to establish themselves, but for Kamal it seems to be a
quick path.</p>

<p>Being a rationalist and possibly an excellent thinker I guess, he is able to make
his moves quickly and hit opponents in the right spot. Signs are out that Hindu
extremist groups and political wing the BJP are starting to piss their pants.</p>

<p>Recently a person from some terror group in India has called for the execution of
Kamal and his fans just because he wrote an article saying that Hindu terror
is rising in this nation. I am really surprised, rather than ignoring and laughing
at Kamal they have gone to start a fight with him, this is exactly what a truthful
person wants, when wrong doers start to fight, it means one is closer to victory.</p>

<p>However history cannot be judged, anything could happen. Gandhi agreed to Pakistan,
after its creation he had plans to arose the conscience of people across both
sides and start a non violent struggle for unification, but then Hindu extremist
shot and killed him. The same thing could happen to Kamal.</p>

<p>Hindu’s, Aryans have no moral defense against Dravidians. Research
proves that Indus script closely matches Tamil than any other language. Possibly
we Dravidians are the true owners of Afganistan, Pakistan, and Infian main land,
and were slowly
pushed down to the peninsula till we became finally powerful and undefeatable.</p>

<p>Aryans are awry of history and wanted to disagree with findings and wanted people
to believe
they own India 100% and its Hinduism is everything that India needs. This is as
stupid as Pakistan which says its Islam is all that it needs. Now look at
Pakistanis, look how they are? Till yesterday they were slave to United states,
now they are slave to China. Of course this that not vindicate India as it has
become 100% slave and colony of United States now.</p>

<p>So lets see, whats your opinion, try voting the poll I created. Who do you
support Kamal or the extremist?</p>
