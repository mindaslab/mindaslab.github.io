    <p>You are a proud programmer, you know Ruby and there is no programming language
like it, and all of a sudden you are caught up in a situation thats unrelated to
you. Sales of the software slumps and your boss yells at your team. You don’t
know what’s happening, but you are made to work hard, atleast sit in your office,
make some cold marketting calls. What you must do? The best answer is to leave
the business and find something else.</p>

<p>I find not so easy as a programer and as an artist that businesses are not able
to understand ones skills and are unable to utilize ones talent. Imagine you are
an author in 1960’s, you write a novel, a publisher likes it and pays for you
to complete it. You complete it and goback to him, then he says that as a writer
you must understand the publishing business, you say you do, then he shows a
press machine and tells you to operate it. Imagine how stupid it will be?</p>

<p>If you think its absurd to tell the writer to operate the press machine, you
should think how absurd Info Tech companies are operating in India and around
the world. People with money seem to have no clue how to run a company. People
have left programming a while ago and seem to forget how to be a programmer,
they seem to forget the pressures programmer faces.</p>

<p>Its like press or publishing house been run by a person who doesn’t know what
it means to be a writer.</p>
