<p>Just moments ago, about 3:40 PM went up to terrace to water my plants, it was a pristine Sun that shone upon Sithalapakkam, Chennai. The same kind of Sun that shown in Gandhinagar, Adyar 4th main road where I grew up. The air was relatively cold of winter and the sun warmed my skin. It was a good feeling. but a time bomb is waiting for Sithalapakkam.</p>

<p>Around every day about 200 huge lorries of water is mined from Sithalapakkam’s grounds, right in front of our eyes. My estimate is 200, I don’t know how much more. Each lorry carries about 20,000 litres of water into Chennai, the city of thirst. I am not against mining of water, but it should be done in a sustainable manner.</p>

<p>When I stepped into Sithalapakkam 5years ago, the Sithalapakkam lake would almost always be full, even in dry May, but as I gazed upon lake I see mostly grassland and a buffalo grazing upon it.</p>

<p>Many areas in Sithalapakkam people have reported that borewells have gone dry like in places Shankarapuram, Venba Avenue and much more. Peoples welfare association of Sithalapakkam have repeatedly given complaint to the panchayat and yet no action has been taken despite assurance. Even higher government officials are quiet mum because Chennai should not thirst.</p>

<p>I don’t know what to say. When I was young the water in Gandhinagar Adyar was at 40 feet and it tasted sweet. When I was about 20 it was about 200 feet and tasted salty. People must think, rather than embark on a mad quest to void and depleting everything, one must seek sustainable form of development.</p>

<p>So if you you are a resident of Sithalapakkam, please save money to buy water for your home. If you are from Chennai, I thank you in advance for giving us suffering.</p>
