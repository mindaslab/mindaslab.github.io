    <p>I am employees in a place where they hired for open source development (or kinda guide people here), I had a linux system, but they lifted it out and installed Windows 8 for security reasons! Don‚Äôt drop your jaw, yes they said its for security reasons. Yes they said it for security reason. I am not drunk, I never ever drink in my life and I am sane and I say: ‚ÄúThey took off linux and installed Windows 8 for security reasons‚Äù.</p>

<p>Okay whats gone is gone, I am quiet tired of trying to convince people about the goodness of linux and have given up. Well it sometimes feel great to be a Galileo among Catholics, an Socrates among Athenians. Then I started to work with Windows 8. I am a guy who likes to hit ode, to satisfy my curiosity. To be frank, humans have bored me, but computers and electronics haven‚Äôt. So I set out to program in Windows 8 and I ran into following stuff.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Moodle won‚Äôt work on Windows</strong><strong> 8</strong></span></p>

<p>My job requires me to have a taste of Moodle. Well, Moodle must work on XAMP, but as it gets installed on a hardware that has 8 core processor and 8 GB RAM which is really decent, it runs into an error, or just gets stuck. In home I have a linux mint desktop with 2GB RAM and I am able to install moodle onto it!</p>

<p>I just can‚Äôt get it. When I put in forums that I can‚Äôt install Moodle on Win 8, one of my friends remarked ‚Äòwho wants moodle installed on windows‚Äô. Well he is right üò¶ . Good grief.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Ruby on Rails won‚Äôt work all well on Win 8</strong></span></p>

<p>I got Ruby on Rails running on Win 8, thanks to Rails Installer project, but when it comes to installing gems like therubyracer, even with the devkit on there are some errors thrown out. Looks like I have to compile everything from Ruby from source to get things working. Well, cool! Who has time for that?</p>

<p>And when¬† ever I seek forums for help, people answer thinking I use Linux or Mac, none respects Windows now. Well, why should they respect a dying evil thing?</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Pain to get Netbeans running</strong></span></p>

<p>I got Netbeans running on jre7, then I had to install Java to test out selenium, then the pain started, though I¬† installed JDK, unlike linux that won‚Äôt be recognized. I have to find a file called netbeans.conf, change its permissions, edit jdk path and blah blah. Plus the security settings that winows provides is crap, it isn‚Äôt as powerful and simple as linux. Boy! I wasted an hour for that.</p>

<p>I could go on and on like this, but let me cut short it here. If you want to build a career on development, don‚Äôt ever buy a Windows PC. Buy one with Linux, that‚Äôs where all the fun is.</p>
