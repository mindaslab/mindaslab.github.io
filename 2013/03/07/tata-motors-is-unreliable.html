    <p class="wp-caption-text">TATA Nano, The vehicle that’s a junk.</p>

<p>I own a Tata Nano, and it sucks Not the vehicle looks, but its engineering and service sucks. Its better that none should buy any vehicle from Tata Motors. I will explain why.</p>

<p>In January when I finished lunch in  hotel and started my car, its engine began to rise on its own as though I had pressed its accelerator, I called for emergency help and two guys came and did something and the problem was solved.  The very next day I had to rush to another business meet and I started my car my engine began to raise again. I had to abandon my car at home and use a call taxi to attend the meet. The car was taken to Tafe Reach, a Tata Motors service center in Greams road and the engine raise was solved. But when the vehicle arrived at home there were three more problems.</p>

<p>First the vehicles clutch failed. It was surprising, my vehicle had run only 11,000 Kilometers, usually even the most worst clutch fails at 1 lakh kilometers. Poor engineering, poor poor engineering. Not even even a toy car maker would put on such a defective part into his toy.</p>

<p>The second, both back brakes failed! They failed 100% and I had to run on with 50% brake power. To make matters worst the car started to turn slightly left when the breaks failed!</p>

<p>As if that wasn’t enough the Air-conditioners failed. I truly began to wonder did they repair my car or transfer some old parts into my car and gave me back so that I need to shell money on servicing? Truly I am still wondering.</p>

<p>So I gave it for servicing again. They fixed up the clutch and gear and its now okay, but then just a week after it ran the Air conditioner brake 100% and brakes seem to be failing. Christ curse the TATA. May it burn in hell. So once again I had given it for servicing along with another problem.</p>

<p>I am quiet sure that another problem wont be fixed. I will put that in another blog along with picture.</p>

<p>Yes TATA nano is easy to drive and saves lot of fuel. But I think the cost of repairing the car is too high. They still charge you even if they say say that they offer 4 year warranty. That’s a kind of cheating. Warranty means its a warrant. It means WARRANT. A <a href="http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/warrant?q=warrant">WARRANT</a> RIGHT? Its quiet a bluff they sell to you.</p>

<p>Its not just TATA nano. All TATA vehicles share the same fate. Good marketing will make you buy the vehicle, but then the service an promise they give you are totally junk. If you want to know how much I am suffering because of this and how much business loss I have incurred, don’t feel hesitant  to call me on  +91 9444018524. I will be happy to educate the world about the true face of TATA motors.</p>
