    <p>Nokia (which is nothing but now Microsoft)  and Apple are absolutely waste. This blog discusses why.</p>

<p>Well, Nokia was once phone leader. Almost every phone sold in developing world was Nokia, and it dominated the markets of developed world too. When Nokia made low tech phones, Samsang about 6 years back was rolling out smart phones that was quiet crap, so almost none got Samsung. Samsung had great ideas on how phones should be, but the hardware did not advance much to Samsungs expectations.</p>

<p>Then came Steve Jobs. Though an idiot who must have been hated by his engineers, he had excellent powers of persuasion and believed what he thought was right. Though iPhone and even the iPod were not his idea, he made the world believe it was his. He created mass hysteria, so these devices sold a lot, makers making the parts for it, for example SSD (solid state drives) have to increase production and reduce cost.</p>

<p>With these new devices, apple started to put patents like slide to unlock, ignoring the fact that for thousands of years humans have used door locks that need to slide to be unlocked!!! And those Apple stupids claim it as their own ingenious invention. Never mind, human heard of goat heads got excited and got bought products.</p>

<p>Apples operating system and hardware are proprietary, meaning say you want to tinker with it, like add a chip to iPhone to increase its memory, Apple will sue you or at least make your phone not work. Even if you want to install a software, Apple must know about it.</p>

<p>Google on the other hand does want users to not use Google on phones. Plus since phones and tablets are networked devices, Google wanted them to get connected to its servers all the time so that they can know about you, monitor you and give out best results depending on your activity. For example if you text your friend that you can’t manage your child, Google will pick it up and it will recommend a child psychiatrist or a baby sitter. If Google knows that you have problem with your spouse, it will recommend you a marriage counselor or a divorce lawyer and would collect advertising fees. Google clearly realized that people accessed internet more on handhelds than desktops or laptops. So it created an operating system called Android and gave it away free.</p>

<p>Samsung, HT and other companies took this Android, modified them to their wish and put them on in their phones. Google cleverly made it opensource so that more people started to write software for Android. This ensured that there will be more software available on Android than iPhone or a Windows phone. Apple and Nokia-Microsoft started to tremble, and possible annihilation was on the horizon.</p>

<p>Unable to compete technically and unable to generate ideas that would keep them on market, they bought companies which had stupid patents (similar to slide to unlock) and have formed a consortium called Rockstar alliance along with good for nothing blackberry. Now hey are planning to sue Android phone makers like HTC and Samsung and hope that this irritation will make them stay more longer on the market.</p>

<p>Patents suck, the world need to realize that. Patents stem innovation and competition. Patents serve only huge companies that are unable to compete with little organizations, sue them so that little ones will go bankrupt just fighting the case against big ones. Wonder when humanity will truly take a step against patents?</p>

<p>If you read this blog, please stop buying Nokia or iPhone or any of Apple or Microsoft products (any way none buys a blackberry). These companies are only interested in making money by filling patent suits on innovations that benefit humanity. They want to earn money and retard intellectual progress and freedom of human race.</p>

<p>Buy Android phones or better Ubuntu Phone.</p>
