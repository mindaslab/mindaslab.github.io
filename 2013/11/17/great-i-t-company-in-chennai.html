    <p>I have tried regular job and I have been a consultant, had my own firms and blah blah. I find one thing common in I.T industry today. employees are simply treated as slaves. They must be worked out so that every praise from the client can be extracted showing off their work. This trend is prevalent in big I.T majors HCL, TCS, CTS, Wipro, Infosys and blah blah.</p>

<p>Many souls have been irrecoverably broken. On one side there is a mental torture from your company. On the other there is a torture from your family, which fails to understand you and forces you to stick with these slave trading majors.</p>

<p>Its not just these big majors,I have had problem with small companies too. In one company called Orxxxin xexxning, where I worked as tech specialist, I was invited into room one day and was said that I never worked for a month. I really walked into the cabin for a constructive meeting, then I was slapped with this ridiculous charges. This made me sleepless for two days and I quit. I am quiet sure if something like God exist, they will spit blood and die. More worst one of my friends called me after I quit and said that they said he did not perform for last one year. He was almost in tears.</p>

<p>In another company that supplies learning products called Exxerxus rightly located in Kilpauk (famous for its mental institute), I encountered a pure psycho. Though the company is not to be blamed, I wonder why they did not reign in on that psycho who would just yell on me for no reason. No wonder souls working under him were miserable. But there I also notice another guy called Suresh who was a excellent peoples man. If its not for him, the team would have disintegrated.</p>

<p>There is a middle and/or top layer in many companies which simply doesn’t work, which simply doesn’t know what technology is, yet its slightly smart enough to realize that it can fill its pockets with money earned by offering tech products and services and those people turn out to be those ghosts spoiling lifes of the people who work there.</p>

<p>What can middle class do? We live month by month. Just one month of no salary and have to make huge adjustments. I gave up. Just gave up in and thought that the team I had under my company was the luckiest. That gave me a little satisfaction. Thankfully people who worked under me reflect to the days under me as bliss. Its the greatest thing I have done in my life. I am very proud and happy about it.</p>

<p>But then. To my joy there is a company which does care for its employees, I just stumbled upon it. Its called Beyond Universe and its sister Inexgames. I teach Ruby on Rails there and know its employees personally. I have met its boss and and he seems to have “don’t push the employee” philosophy. All I have interacted are happy with that company. and I am so happy to be associated with it. Even its peon is happy. I have seen that no where. Not even in the firm I had.</p>

<p>Its boss Mr. Swamy seems to be a great listener. I only hope his philosophy spreads and every boss out there and makes them get a good heart like him. I am so happy to see a pocket among this city of slaves where people explore technology and strive to do things in the way they like.</p>

<p>If you are brilliant mind, try working there. don’t worry about money. You will become some one great. I hope that company stays blowing life into people forever.</p>
