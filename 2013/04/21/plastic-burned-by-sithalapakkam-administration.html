<p>Once considered a beautiful place for a living, slowly but surely Sithalapakkam is turning into  hell hole for its citizens. Water that was once abundant here, now is becoming a scarce resource, many bores in Sitalapakkm have turned dry. Then there is absolutely no good garbage disposal mechanism here.</p>

<p>Today morning while I was having my breakfast, my room was suddenly filled with smoke. I wondered what and looked out and was shocked to see that panchayat workers were burning garbage just few feet off my home.  This garbage did contain lot of plastic and its smell filled the air.</p>

<p>My simple question is this, I know that its illegal to burn plastic in a place surrounded by homes, so the panchayat of Sithalapakkam is responsible for this illegal act. Shouldn’t it issue an apology, dissolve itself and hold reelection for the people to choose a new able sensible leader?</p>

<p>If the panchayat says that the workers are not knowledgeable and are ignorant about burning plastic, then why the heck  the panchayat  put such a people for such an important job like garbage disposal?</p>

<p>They say some guy called Arul rule this Sithalapakkam, but seeing thee troubles Sithalapakkam undergoes like accumulating garbage, inability to dispose them safely, the dog trouble that persists here, the lack of metaled roads laid in inner parts of Sithalapakkam, the illegal mining of water and sand from here and many others. If he is a decent man, shouldn’t he offer an apology and step down?</p>

<p>What happened to the leaders energy? To get votes these people come to our door step, but when they get elected they hide away like snails. Wish they had enough brains that would match that of snails. Why should we have a leader who isn’t educated enough to know how to dispose plastic waste? துப்பு இல்லாதவர்கள் தலைவராக இருந்தால் என்ன நன்மை கிடைக்கும்?</p>
