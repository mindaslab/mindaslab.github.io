    <p class="wp-caption-text">Try building a business with heart, you may succeed.</p>

<p>I have worked almost every level in the I.T field. There is one startling thing I notice, most businesses are heartless, and so are some employees. Each view each other as threat. This is a very sad thing. They forget why there is Business and why there is Work.</p>

<p>A business should be established so that it can bring smile to faces of humans. People must work so that they may go to bed that night knowing that they have contributed something good to humanity. That should be the purpose of Capitalism. A worker must have the belief that the company (s)he works in will protect him and not let down. A business must have belief that employees will work in it during crisis and will not behave like rats in a sinking ship, this trust must be there. This is what I call business.</p>

<p>Instead today I see the opposite. Business wants to get workers at the cheapest cost so that they can be more profitable, they want to exploit every drop of his blood so that one does the work of more than a person could possibly do. If the person fails, even for a moment of time, the business mercilessly finds another one to replace him and fires him.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are certain group of workers who just want to use business as their money source and nothing else. They are constantly focused on pay hike, and they think it must reach them some how by magic. Those who are in higher position often blame the people under them for failures and seek a way to continue to be inefficient and trustable. When will all this end?</p>

<p>The problem boils down to good heart and communication. A business or a bosses should never see people working under him as people who does some job and get away with money. He must trust them. Tell them what his or her idea is, and if accomplished what will happen and how the wealth will be distributed. Once the goals are reached, the word must be kept up. When there are hiccups, the boss should be tolerant to accept it. Else one must establish a business purely based on robots which are systematic and commit no error.</p>

<p>Its sad to see many business fail to do that. They think their workers as looters, say they are distracted even if he or she reads a magazine in office listens to music or does some thing else. Mind you no worker can’t work for 8 hours a day. If he can, then his work can easily be replaced by robots. Yet companies, even I.T companies which below its huge brand names put a subtitle that they are a knowledge and intellectual based business and make people think, do not keep up to their mantra.</p>

<p>The only way to solve this problem is to trust the younger generation. Rather than madly falling into the I.T or brand name trap, each and every one that comes out of college must think, “Can I have my own business? Can I make people smile by running it? Or will it bring tears? How can I start a business with heat?”</p>

<p>I don’t say that you will succeed just by reading my blog, but all I know is all young ones reading my blog start to think like this, at least one will will be able to spin a tiny business that has a heart in it.</p>
