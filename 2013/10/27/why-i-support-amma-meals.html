<p>Though I have called her mad many times, Jayalaliha is quiet bold. But for some reason I don’t seem to like her, say for her thought of closing down Anna Library and so on. But I fully support her Amma meals scheme.</p>

<p>Many of my friends are against this meals scheme. They say that this would make people lazy and blah blah. Well can they really prove that hard working people are the richest and lazy people are the poorest?</p>

<p>Throughout history, excellent minds are the most tormented, and have become financially weak part of the society. Take for instance Subramaniya Bharathiyar. He mostly spent his life almost with no money. Great minds try to change the world to their way because they see something good in it, and the world afraid of change resists it. This makes them socially backward, but something has to keep them going. If something basic like food is not offered for subsidy, these minds that can bring a good change may breakdown i desperation.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs ate free food, so did Prophet Muhammed, Jesus, Buddha, Aadi Shankarar. You eat free food at temples and religious institutions and you don’t blame these great people who ate free food as lazies, nor do you tell these institutions that offer free food as lazy creators? Why?</p>

<p>Not all in our life is paid. We get free sunlight, free distilled water from sky, free oxygen from plants. The Earth never asked us money, the sea doesn’t charge money to our fishermen, the universe doesn’t charge money to reveal its secrets, nor does evolution charges money to have given us such a great brain that generates ideas. Its man the only one known that assigns values to things and makes himself pay.</p>

<p>Capitalism is a rigged system. You read this blog because you were born to relatively wealthy parents. Most Indians of your age may not even have a computer because they wee born into slums. How will they compete against us? Or is the wealth we have100% halal? Did we make sure that we had never paid bribe, made sure that customer we help, the companies we worked for are pure and bribe free?</p>

<p>So the points are clear</p>

<p>Well, what a species!!!! And to note, Jaya is not offering free food, but an subsidized one.</p>
