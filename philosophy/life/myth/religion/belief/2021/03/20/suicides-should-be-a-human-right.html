<blockquote>
  <p>I thought you how to live, I’ll teach you how to die - Socrates</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In many parts of the world, one can choose their own leaders. Well, that’s what we are told to believe, and we are also told that we have control of our life, it’s our life and our right until we infringe upon some one else’s right. Well then why shouldn’t one have the right to kill oneself?</p>

<h2 id="you-are-not-infringing-on-others-right">You are not infringing on others right</h2>

<p>When one kills himself, or the better herself :D, that person is not infringing on other peoples right, but they are just shutting off. That’s it. It’s their idea that this universe and humanity sucks and they don’t belong here, I feel if any society calls itself free should honour it.</p>

<h2 id="why-they-tell-its-wrong">Why they tell its wrong</h2>

<p>I don’t really know why they say it’s wrong and why many religious and political leaders encourage one to live despite making lives hard. May be because if say some one says “God I want mutton briyani now”, and to his dismay discovers that God doesn’t deliver and he kills himself, then the amount of money the religious leader gets when all people who discover that God does not exist and commit suicide dwindles. The religious leader, can’t have a great life, and most religious leaders are control freaks who want to control lot of people. If people are not afraid of death, then this control becomes really hard, and if they don’t work for him he may not have the life he or she desires. Imagine how Nithyanadha would feel of Ranjitha killed herself rather than sleeping with him.</p>

<p>Till this day, we were made to believe leaders of business, religion and politics should be respected and its because of them people have a better life, but when Corona struck and human interaction was banned the world productivity dropped, some how all of a sudden the world realised that it’s productivity comes out of people who work, rather than from the people who have money, dream and thought.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He who is not afraid to die is your master - Roman saying</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Plus say your boss threatens you with a miserable life, only to find out that you have killed yourself the next day, he would feel frustrated, definitely his business would suffer some loss, and if people are bold enough to commit suicide, bosses can’t really abuse them. Human productivity is built on abuse, frustration, sweat and blood than humaness. If people escape these things quick, then these people can’t say to the world they had made it more productive and they are successful and have a large house, a car because of their work (which they really didn’t do).</p>

<p>Possibly its because of that its said that killing yourself is cowardice and the comedy is throwing before enemy fire and defending against enemy is also a near act of suicide, but those things are glorified :D</p>

<p>So one getting killed is wrong if it’s weakens the institutional leaders, and if killing of you strengthens them, then it’s right.</p>

<h2 id="spain-granting-rights-to-die">Spain granting rights to die</h2>

<p>Recently I saw a news that Spain is granting rights to die for people who are in severe medical pain. That’s a good step, but I feel its rubbish that any civilisation could call itself free if it does not allow killing of oneself as easy buying a briyani. But ya briyani is prized really high because of human stupidity, well that’s another blog.</p>
