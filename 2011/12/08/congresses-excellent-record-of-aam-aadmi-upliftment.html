    <p class="wp-caption-text">Stunning Sonia ðŸ˜‰ Is her heart is as pure as her looks?</p>

<p>Its unquestionably true that congress has excellent record of uplifting the aam aadmi (common man). Every body must agree with it. And the congressmen wish to do their service to them until their last breadth. Its quiet unimaginable the faith that congress people have on the common man.</p>

<p>In congress record there is only one family that gets the aam aami status, its a family named Gandhiâ€™s which is now headed by Sonia Gandhi.</p>

<p>Recently I was shocked to read in papers that Google has reported that the Congress government has issued one of the highest censoring request, most of which concerning Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh. The question is why they asked to censor? What are those contents? And why Indians should not know about peoples views about their leader no matter how good or bad it is?</p>

<p>Why the congress government want to keep us in the dark? We have licked the shoes of the Gandhiâ€™s since the rule of Indra Gandhi, why we must must keep doing it? Are they gods? Whats the difference between Thailand and India? In Thailand all content against the stupid monarchy are censored, in India all negative content about Gandhiâ€™s are censored. Could we call ourself civilized and democratic any more?</p>

<p>This is a pure betrayal that the congress party has unleashed upon as because they donâ€™t want their gods to be defamed by democracy and free speech. Its a pure betrayal to Tamilians too. We Tamilians have voted the Gandhiâ€™s to power even though we knew that Rajiv sent his troops to kill our brothers and rape our sisters, male thousands of kids orphans in Srilanka, and we Tamilians are proud of it! We are also proud of killing our mother language and embracing Hindhi and English. Yet the congress wants us to do more. Why?</p>

<p>If you make a child study, feed poor, do social service it goes unnoticed. but if some one from that blue blood goes intoÂ  a hut, there is media, news, debate on how he future prime minister should be, and how he is the only god who can uplift us all.</p>

<p>All I want is my fellow citizens to think. Why are the Gandhiâ€™s and the Congress censoring the internet? If they have truly done nothing wrong why are the afraid of free and hate speech?</p>

<p>Think people think. There is something brewing. If we miss the chance now, we can never become free humans again.</p>
