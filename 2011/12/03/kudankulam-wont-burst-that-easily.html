    <p><img class="aligncenter" title="Kudankulam Nuclear Reactor" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.thehindubusinessline.com/multimedia/dynamic/00520/BL04_STATES_KUDANKU_520134f.jpg" alt="" width="463" height="305" /></p>

<p>When it was started, Kudankulam reactor was hailed as an achievement, but now people are up against it. They have got a point. Fukushima reactor went pop and entire settlements have to evacuated and it must be repaired and damages evened before life could proceed. If relatively uncorrupted Japan could become helpless, imagine what will be plight of Indians if one of the reactor’s burst here?</p>

<p>My heart is for nuclear technology, I love it and I feel every nation on this planet must master it and gain from it, but in a corrupt nation like India it could become a disaster if the reactor pops.</p>

<p>But todays nuclear reactor technology has advanced so much that reactor bursting off is like a person getting struck by a lightning thrice. Lot of brains, planning, multi level security systems are in place that will prevent the reactor going all out pop.</p>

<p>If you are a smoker living Kudankulam, you have more probability of dieing by cancer due to smoking than due to radiation or the reactor bursting. But still one won’t quit smoking, do they?</p>

<p>More life’s are shattered in this nation by blind faith and religions than nuclear reactors and science. But this does not stop one worshiping God!?</p>

<p>The protests by Kudankulam is all panic. The same kind of panic that made humans think snakes are evil. And political parties who have almost no brains about how nuclear technology work support them to get some mileage.</p>

<p>This is Tamilnadu, not West Bengal where projects gets jeopardized (by politicians like Mamata Banerjee) thus ruining state and others. Lets show the nation who we are and save the investment this nation has made trusting us.</p>

<p>Even if by due to some improbability if that reactor bursts, lets lay down our life’s as Tamilians for our motherland, like we have been doing for centuries.</p>
