    <p>I have never done business wit others money. Thank God its all mine. But I will be doing with other persons money soon ( in fact I am doing it, a kind of ). My poor little investment manager is making ready of the docs that attracts the big fish. To understand how this all stupid stuff works I read a book on managing some software project.

<p>All crap. Crap, crap, crap. I wonder how these people read this MBA. They are no less than fuckers. Won’t they go off to sleep in class, drool to death in their benches or something?</p>

<p>I just don’t understand it. Why can’t people just code, and why can’t people see the finished product and invest on it. It sucks, really sucks. In the name of VC’s, possible future business predictions and the art of staring a graphs, these MBA’s are spoiling our entire humanity. They are wasting 1000’s of people’s productivity.</p>

<p>I don’t know where all this is going to end. They are taking this simple business, adding all those buzz words and ruining it. Fuck them up.</p>
