<p>Its interesting. People of Tamilnadu are totally un-interested with Karunanidhi‚Äôs family raj. The result of this election could be close one or victory to ADMK and from then on all will be a comedy.</p>

<p>Jayalalitha is a dictator. She wants every one to say ‚Äúyes amma‚Äù or else you are dead. In her last rule it was a great comedy. she changed ministers now and then. They were changed so much that many didn‚Äôt even know what portfolio they had. It was having breakfast at one office in the morning, noon lunch at another and dinner at the third one.</p>

<p>The next stuff was dismissing entire government work force. I agree with it. What do these government employees do? All they do is to sit in office and get bribes as duties. One of my dear friend is a government employee.When he went and asked a girl to marry him, she was more interested in knowing how much bribes he got than how much salary he received! Though her (Jaya‚Äôs )move sent¬† jolt through these corrupt minds, the government ground to a halt.</p>

<p>The next stupid thing she did was to dismiss all transport employees and the public bus transport in Chennai halted. Thousands were left with no way to go to office. They were stuck and very terribly stuck. I still remember people, common working people, trying to get ride in my college bus to get to work. My driver strictly refused their begging.</p>

<p>If Jayalalitha accuses Karuna of family rule,then is she so pure? She works for Sasikala family. Jaya does have her favourite people and she works for them. She also has the record of leading one of the most corrupt government. If the spectrum scam is proved,then it will become the second most corrupt government I think (only after DMK). Hey! We Tamils are great looters.</p>

<p>If Jaya becomes the CM, Sethu Samuthiram channel won‚Äôt be completed. This woman is a strict Hindu and don‚Äôt want to destroy a structure thats said to be built by a fucking bow carrying nomad who roamed into our land. Neither Jaya has the will to make Tamil our national language and spread Tamilian cause and values around the world. Though I am sure Karuna is a looter, I love him for his brains and his love for Tamil.</p>

<p>Yes Jaya has done some good things to Tamilnadu, some of it are</p>

<p>1. She completed mini veeranam project which brings some water to Chennai</p>

<p>2. Koyambedu bus terminus was finished in her rule (DMK childishly claims it had planned it first)</p>

<p>3. She killed Veerappan, a forest bandit. Though the (Kannada and Tamilian) police atrocities against the local people were hugely covered up.</p>

<p>4. She started anna-dhanam (free food) distribution scheme in temples. Its supposed to give free food for all. In many temples only the elite and upper cast people are served. The poor are left off.</p>

<p>Jayalalitha (ADMK) cannot give good governance like the one given by DMK. DMK‚Äôs are too professionals even for any other party in any other state to beat them (they are professional looters too). How ever I wish this stupid queen will be less stupid if she comes to power this time and possibly do some infrastructure development with the rapidity done by the DMK‚Äôs.</p>

<p>I also hope she will play a major role in unearthing 2G scam. Though its my belief that all who are in 2G scam will walk away free in near future.</p>
