    <p>One thing I note now is that I am spending more time on diaspora than any other social network I use. The reason are as follows</p>

<p id="caption-attachment-854" class="wp-caption-text">Great UI for posting your thought</p>

<p>Just look at the UI. It has got a camera icon that when clicked helps you to upload a picture into post. This feature now I see it in twitter. Next you can see a green button that lets you to share with only certain group of people called aspects. For example you could group all your school friends into an aspect and share with only them. These aspects were copied by google+ and is now called circles in it. You can share your post with multiple aspects too.</p>

<p>You can link your twitter, facebook and tumbler accounts to diaspora, and right from it (diaspora) you can post your thought to multiple social networks. This feature is already found in twitter where when you tweet, it gets posted on to your facebook wall, but twitter does not give you a choice weather or not that post should be posted on facebook or not (by default it gets posted baring retweets and mentions). On this count diaspora leads.</p>

<p>Another new addition to diaspora is its markdown. Yup you can now type in mark down, see this shot where I have tested it!</p>

<p id="caption-attachment-855" class="wp-caption-text">Diaspora now supports markdown</p>

<p>This feature is yet to come on facebook. I think google+ hasn’t got this one yet.</p>

<p><strong>Music Sharing</strong></p>

<p>We all love music, we like to share them. Diaspora supports inline music sharing. Just look, I just put the URL of a music track and diaspora let me play / listen music right away from its website.</p>

<p id="caption-attachment-858" class="wp-caption-text">music sharing on diaspora</p>

<p>This feature I think rocks and is not available in any other social network.</p>

<p>Diaspora offers better freedom than other social networks. Including complete deletion of your account from its server, just in case. It has greatest privacy feature. You can post a message that can only be viewed by your family members and not by any other, thus your privacy is well guarded.</p>

<p>If you are a techie and have resources enough, you can set up your own diaspora server, thus getting full control of your data. Finally diaspora is a free software, any one can examine its source code and understand how it works. So chances for fraud and secret spying is almost nil.</p>

<p>Hope you people try out this excellent software. For those who wish to get an invite from diaspora post your email ID as comment to this post. I will be glad to invite you.</p>
