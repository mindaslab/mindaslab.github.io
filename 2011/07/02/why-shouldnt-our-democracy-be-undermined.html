<p>The congress party accuses Anna Hazare of undermining Indian democracy. Well, why shouldn’t it be undermined? Democracy has done and is doing more evil to us than good. The political class has found an efficient way to make our democracy and judicial system ineffective. In short we Indians suck.</p>

<p>Right from the time of Pundit Jawaharlal Nehru, there was corruption in India in one form or the other. We are waking up to it now because of media, namely more newsprint, television and the internet, other wise Manmohan Singh would have been coined Nehru the second.</p>

<p>Rajiv Gandhi was elected on popular vote, but in his time did we see the Bofors scam and slaying of Tamils in Srilanka. Indira Gandhi was elected democratically but she turned out to be a dictator. BJP was elected to give stable government for 5 years, they gave it but they flirted too much with the rich and forgot the poor.</p>

<p>Politicians are no more than day light cheaters who loot a ton from us and we have no way to stop it in the present system.</p>

<p>Scam after scam after scam after scam, and false promise after false promise after false promise after false promise. We are humans, not Gods, how much can we bear? I think its time that we all undermine democracy and strive for our freedom from politicians. After all God did not device this democracy, but flawed humans did.</p>

<p>This is land where Nakeeran, the famous Tamil poet who challenged and defeated lord Shiva walked. If he could defeat God with truth, why can’t we defeat these looters who rule us? We must device new techniques like <a title="Dynamic Democracy" href="https://karthikeyanblogs.wordpress.com/2010/01/31/dynamic-democracy/" target="_blank">Dynamic democracy</a> so that politicians become true servants of the people. Unless we take a bold step, we will be informal slaves of the political class.</p>
