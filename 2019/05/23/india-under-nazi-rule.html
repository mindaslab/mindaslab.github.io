<p>So the BJP has won. I wonder weather there will be another central government election in India. Or whether we will spiral into wars defeating our neighbours and so a leader who will be our warlord will rule our country forever? Let’s see.</p>

<p>For beef lovers, the days are done. I think its time for them to quit India and go to a liberal nation. There is no guarantee that there would be no lynching and killing of people who love to eat beef.</p>

<p>Any one who questions the government will be called an Anti-Indian, would be put into trouble by government officials and would be jailed, poisoned there and if they are still not yielding they would disappear. For example loot at the fate of Piyush Manush, he is been tortured now and then, Thirumurugan Gandhi is poisoned, and Mugilan has disappeared, most probably he has been killed in a brutal way, who knows?</p>

<p>I was looking at the behaviour of Modi, his behaviour and that of Adolf Hitler are very similar. Let me tell you waht I found:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Both Hitler and Modi started from humble beginnings. Hitler was a simple solder, a painter dreaming big for his nation and Modi was working in a tea shop.</li>
  <li>Both Modi and Hitler love their nation. Thats unquestionable.</li>
  <li>Both have a strong feeling that what they think and do is the right thing for the nation.</li>
  <li>Both don’t listen to intellectuals around them, take for instance the demonetisation.</li>
  <li>Both are narcissist and, love do grand things so that people praise them. They want for their names to be eternal.</li>
  <li>Both have high self discipline and are relatively uncorrupt.</li>
  <li>Hitler had Himler with him and Modi has Amit Shah.</li>
  <li>Both Nazi party and BJP has a violent and ultra nationalist wing attached with it, for Nazi’s its the SS, for BJP its the RSS.</li>
  <li>Both have a reason to hit at neighbours. For the Nazi’s its the greatness of Germany. Here I strongly suspect how there could be a bomb blast in Pulwama if we have strong Chowkidars who guard the nation. Or they are Chowkidars for name sake and are real dummies?</li>
  <li>Modi is loved by international committee and so was Hitler, until the day realised his true intentions.</li>
  <li>Both Hitler and Modi have got the reputation of manipulating governments data. Modi is a economic debacle, so he has told statisticians to manipulate data so that the economy looks good. Hitler manipulated government economic data too. Almost none in public knew the money spent for killing jews. But under Hitler, economy improved, under Modi it slides down.</li>
  <li>The press in Nazi Germany was highly controlled by the Nazi party, and so is the same case in India. Watch the news channels, there would always be a pro Modi news that has no substance.</li>
  <li>Freedom of expression was highly controlled.
    <ul>
      <li>Take for instance women trying to enter Aiyappan, God is equal to all, but they are still been denied the right despite the court ruling in favour of them.</li>
      <li>Take for instance the killing of Gauri Lankesh and how the case is still unsolved.</li>
      <li>In Tamilnadu take for instance ruining of the life of Perumal Murugan by Hindu’s.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So lets see what the future holds. I feel Modi’s brain and attitude is on a knife edge he could be just a normal PM and he could be a psycho like Hitler. Unlike Vajpyee and like Hitler he has no patience and self control and could let loose. In fact Modi has done it, in Nazi Germany Jews were persecuted and in Modi Gujarat Muslims were slain.</p>

<p>In this land, miracles have happened, Chand Ahoka became Ashoka The Great, Alexanders Violent push to rule the Earth came to an end, we defeated the greatest empire at that time (ruled by Winston Chruchill, a blood thirsty Englishman who starved us to death) without firing a shot. Lets see whether this land would go into dark ruins because of this mad man called Modi and his Hindu clan, or lets see whether our soil turns him into nice one.</p>
