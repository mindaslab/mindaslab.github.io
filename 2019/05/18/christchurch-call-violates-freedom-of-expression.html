<p>The Christchurch Call simply does not stand in accordance with freedom of expression. It says violent and terrorist videos that are online must be eliminated, but why? Why it’s wrong to portray violence online? I don’t understand. Are we humans going to act as though we are not a violent species? That sucks.</p>

<p>Right from the time of chimps we have been violent. There are documented evidences showing that chimps do conduct genocide and mass murder, we just continue it. It’s just part of us.</p>

<p>Next comes the issue of what’s terrorism. Bhagatsingh is a hero in India and terrorist in the U.K. Osama Binladen is a hero to many Muslims around the world, to others he’s a terrorist. Nathuram Gotse is a nationalist to hardline Hindus in India, but a terrorist to rationalist. When whats terror and not terror, and whats violent and whats act of war and self defence varies from perspective to perspective. In that case we can’t say a stuff is violent or not.</p>

<p>Take for example a man slaying his goat for his family. His kids would love to eat it. According to them, their father is kind and non violent person, but according to the goat he is a killer and a terrorist. It all depends on the perspective and we must respect it.</p>

<p>Terrorism, violence, good and bad, etc are all human defined terms and they vary from place to place. It’s stupid to say that what few countries that have signed the Christchurch Call, call as violent and hateful acts are violent and hateful. You in the western world would not call USA’s and UK’s war as a violent act do you? But imagine how many lives it has affected. How many people have felt helpless because of it.</p>

<p>The priminister if Newzeland I suppose has got no other job after her loosing her post, so she is trying to portray herself as a global leader who is soooo good so that she can win again and again. Any way time has presented a very good chance for her.</p>

<p>India too happily signed it because here now cow eaters are being killed, so if any one shares the video of killing on social media, India can show this call and take down the video, thus putting up a scene as though India is a pure nation.</p>
