<p>Today I saw the movie “The Accidental Priminister”, well thats how I spell it :). It was good, wonder why congress supporters don’t like it? Don’t they think that it would be good for Congress and nation if the party does not cater to a single family and caters to people?</p>

<p>In this movie they say Manmohan Singh is just a jaalra to Sonia Gandhi. I believe it’s true. Indira Gandhi was a jaalara to the Soviets, Narasima Rao was a jaalar to the USA. Vajpyee was a jaalara to communal forces and the RSS and so does Modi follows in his footsteps (Vajpyeee did not have the opportunity to commit a genocide though). All our leaders were jaalara to something. So I don’t think its really says bad about Manmohan Singh. He was doing what many so called leaders of our nation did.</p>

<p>One good thing is Sanjaya Banu wrote a book about Manmohan, imagine if some had wrote a book exposing Modi, (s)he would have been named Anti Indian, either he and his family should have fled India or would have disappeared or would have been killed.</p>

<p>So showing Manmohan as jaalara, a truth coming out about a gentleman was not a surprise for me. What I noticed was the movies accuracy of star casting and how they portrayed the PMO and Sonia’s house in detail. Here I am in Sithalapakkam, worrying about my water supply, worrying whether it would be cost effective to turn on my A/C to quench the sweltering heat, worrying about whether to give my car for repair or not, having no clue how will I be 25 years from now, or will I exist 25 years from now? Or before I die will I live in a house that stands besides a tar road. I don’t have water, clean air, future is doubtful, yet the opulence with which these servants of mine who eat my tax money live with stunned me. The parties they attend are top class and they don’t pay for it. Its free for them :(.</p>

<p>I am sure none in power ever sweats or feels cold, they are been cooled and heated by our sweat and blood. The infrastructure they enjoy is like a five seven service every day. I think their medicine too is free. That would explain why many old guys stick to power. While we citizens wait for busses under direct sun, they travel in convoys in nice and cozy environment. Thats what I noticed.</p>

<p>I wonder what makes a Indian accept that a Priminister or President who is our mere servant can have a unrealistic better life than us which we cannot even imagine? Or is it that I am the one who just thinks and all are dumb?</p>
