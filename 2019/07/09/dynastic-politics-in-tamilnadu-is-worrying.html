<p>Its worrying, as a Tamilian its really worrying for me. Udayanidhi Stalin is taking the reigns of D.M.K youth wing. This was a party who’s chief Karunanidhi walked out a meeting when it was proposed Murasoli Maaran should be held up in high ranks, look now whats happening!</p>

<p>I have no idea if the D.M.K people are safeguarding Tamil, just by knowing Tamil today I am unable to earn a comfortable living. The keyboard I type in has English alphabets rather than Tamil ones. Bus signs and numbers are written in English 1..2..3 than Tamil ones, no kid in Tamilnadu knows to do math with Tamil numerals. Even people of D.M.K are polyglot for survival. Kanimozhi’s school Sunshine is a English medium school than Tamil. Many Tamil families want their kids to have a English education than in Tamil. If Tamil disappears, I won’t be surprised.</p>

<p>One thing the D.M.K is doing well just like the Congress is to take care of its head family, that of Karunanidhi’s. That guy, his son and his grandson are politicians. Most of Karuna’s family are successful business people. If a Tamil wanted to have his own business, he must think a lot, he must budget, most probably he must give up that idea of having his own business and must choose to work. Even if he establishes a business, he has good chance of failing. Have you ever thought how the Karuna’s and even AIADMK families have established very successful businesses? Why their success rates are so high? Why we the people who they say they regard greater than their life have to fail and stress so much?</p>

<p>Has a person in DMK ever thought why his son cannot become the party youth chief, but Stalin’s son can? Has AIADMK ever thought why there are many hereditary politicians in their party?</p>

<p>I am happy about North India at least, Rahul is kind of no more and he quits, at least he is acting as though he does not have the power to run the congress any more. Politics and business, it must be run by people who have talent, not by some stupid just because he happens to be of some blood.</p>

<p>I don’t feel India, Tamilnadu especially will have a good time.</p>
