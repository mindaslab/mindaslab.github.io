<p>I am out of a Job. On November I asked my company whether my job was at risk as I was not treated properly, I was told that my job was secure and was assigned to a new project, on Dec 24 I was thrown out. My bank balance is running low, I need to be given 2 months of salary if the company fires me, and I don’t think I am getting it. In fact this month’s salary will be put in next month 15th. Most probably I wont get the full salary, it could be a menial amount.</p>

<p>Soon after I got fired, many people from the company contacted me, they said they too felt a risk of loosing job. They were unhappy how the company was run, how the decisions are taken without any consultation. They also expressed worry about the best minds, the thinkers and outspoken ones got fired. Strange still some are rallying me to form a company. Classic Indian and Middle Eastern tale isn’t it? People suffer and people rally behind a hero, its Krishna in India, Jesus and Muhammad in the Middle east.</p>

<p>Well, its nice to feel like a hero, but the bosses you hate too were hero’s and you rallied behind them one day. They are the ones you loved one day, today you love me, and what’s the guarantee that I wouldn’t be another M.G.R, Karunanidhi or Jayalalitha who looted this people? What’s the guarantee that I won’t think cheap of you one day after you have earned me? Krishna and others are tales, they are mythical beings, I am a man, to know more about me read <em>The Selfish Gene</em>.</p>

<p>To realize your (worker’s) rights, and for you not to be treated as shit, there is a tried and tested way. It’s called a Union. Let’s say that a bright mind in my company is shown the door, this what would happen in union, in it we all act as one, we all walk out of the company and demand justice. Is that happening in any I.T company? If you don’t have the bravery to unionize and stand for other’s pain? Then why you feel bad when you suffer the same pain? Just take as a part of life and move on.</p>

<p>We are brought up as spineless cowards, let’s admit it. I myself have seen many bright minds been shown the door and I haven’t bothered. We have been thought to survive and go about our business even if our neighbors and coworkers are undergoing enormous torture. We studied Engineering to become rich and have a great life and not to be bothered about the wellness of our commune. We ran behind money, signed documents without reading, worried about ourselves and nothing else. Now when the evil ones rule us and strike us in an <em>adharma</em> way we squeal. Well, squeal. That’s what non thinkers and cowards can do.</p>
