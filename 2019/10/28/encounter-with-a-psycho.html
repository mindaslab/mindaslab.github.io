    <p>It has become a ritual that when the marketing person arrives in my office, we both go for a tea and a snack. We both are foodies. The service lane near my office is not too wide, it can fit just two lorries side by side. Friday gone we ventured out in the evening for tea, and we saw a car blocked by a lorry. There was already a cement raw material truck packed along the side and we noticed a strange scene.</p>

<p>A red car was trying to get off the service lane, a waste water truck was parked besides the truck parked at the edge of service lane. The lorry driver was in front of the lorry, though the car is honking and beaming its headlights on him, he was cool, he doesn’t seem to care about the world. It was a very strange scene. Here was a guy who knew that he was causing inconvenience to people, but does not seem to care  about it.</p>

<p>I thought the lorry drivers memory got erased like we see in the movie Men In Black. I thought he forgot everything, about who he is and what he is doing and hence he is behaving in a strange way. The car was honking and flashing light on his face, but he seems not to bother.</p>

<p>Usually when I see such strange people, I keep away. Even if a normal guy known to me behaves strangely I keep away, but my friend raced his bike ahead and encountered the driver. When we enquired about him we came to know that the guy was blocking the road because he was angry that the truck meant for cement raw material was parked in the spot he used to park, out of this anger he was blocking the service lane.</p>

<p>So that driver did not suffer from sudden memory loss like I thought, he had full memory, but was a psycho who does not care about others, but was willing to hurt the world just because he suffered.</p>

<p>I work in Info Tech industry. We hire the best people who are mathematical and logical in their thought, so we don’t see much psycho’s and mentally retarded people in our job. People who are like that get promoted to mangers and other non technical posting because they are able to hurt people if they are not satisfied. To encounter such kind of people is really strange for me. My friend is in marketing, and looks like he seems to deal with psychopaths almost every day.</p>

<p>My friend was a skilful negotiator and made the lorry guy look for another spot for parking and hence the issue was resolved. It was only after my marriage I really encountered psychopathic people often. Before that even in tech field I did encounter psychos, but since I.T field is large, you can shun them and jump off to another project where you will meet a sane mind. But these kind of people fascinate me. I want to know why people are stupid when they can gain so much not being one.</p>

<p>As long as humans are illogical I will be fascinated.</p>
