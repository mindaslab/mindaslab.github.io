<p>The actions of Modi are textbook actions of Hitler. They both share a very similar personality. First, there is no direct evidence that Hitler ordered killing of Jew’s in Germany, and there is no evidence that Modi ordered killing of Muslims in Gujarat, or day to day discrimination of beef eaters in our country.</p>

<p>Hitler was bloody ignorant, fortunately for Germany he was not as ignorant as Modi. But both Modi and Hitler are ignorant enough that they never listen to other people around them. That’s what is happening yo our economy. Demonetization, GST, caused economy to fall and these guys never really acknowledged it until now. Now they take half hearted reforms which are doing nothing much.</p>

<p>The third is going behind political opponents. People, eminent ones wrote a letter against lynching of beef eaters and crimes against minorities in India, now the 49 people who wrote the letter are booked with sedition charge. This is what Hitler did exactly. If any one made him feel uncomfortable, they became threat to Germany and hence serious charges were laid against them and they are banished.</p>

<p>Modi has mastered the art of bending the law to his favor. All over Tamilnadu there is ban on keep roadside banners because it caused a death of a young girl named Subasree. Thankfully since she is a good looking girl, media pulled it up to get viewer count, and this pressure forced the courts to order not to put any kind of banners on street. But for Modi’s Mahabalipuram visit this law doesn’t apply. Banners will be kept praising him and Chinese dictator Xijingping.</p>

<p>Germany was a democracy before the rise ofHitler. Hitler rose and made Germany lick his boots and brought Germany to its doom. The patterns, what Modi does, their psychology matches closely. It would be interesting to see India trip and fall under Modi. Once we have fallen, I wonder how much long will it take for our country to come back as major power again, or will India disappear? I don’t know.</p>
