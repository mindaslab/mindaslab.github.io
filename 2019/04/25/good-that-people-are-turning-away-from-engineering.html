    <p>Its good that people are turning away from Engineering. We have lot and lot of terribly bad engineers. A lot of greed from families who want to become quickly rich from their kids has spoiled a generation, and the result, like a buildings built out of cardboard, we have extremely low quality engineers all around.</p>

<p>Market is market and it responded. Engineers today don’t get respect and they are treated like shit. Lot of people who never ever would have been interested in Science and Technology hold an engineering degree today. And they do menial jobs like data entry and get paid low, really low. I Think I saw it in reddit, a person has complained that an engineering graduate earns less than a pani poori vendor. True, very true.</p>

<p>So as price for an engineer drops, people are moving away from it, and that’s good. Because good engineers who are passionate about their jobs will stick with it, and people who hold engineering degrees and who are not passionate about it will leave. This is a very good correction. I welcome it with a huge smile.</p>
