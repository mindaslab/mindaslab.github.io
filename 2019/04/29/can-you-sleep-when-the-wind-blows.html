    <p>The following story circulated on the Internet - a superb metaphorical exposition of the level of preparedness.</p>

<p>Years ago, a farmer owned land along the Atlantic seacoast.
He constantly advertised for hired hands. Most people were reluctant to work on farms along the Atlantic.</p>

<p>They dreaded the awful storms that raged across the Atlantic, wreaking havoc on the buildings and crops. As the farmer interviewed applicants for the job, he received a steady stream of refusals.</p>

<p>Finally, a short, thin man, well past middle age, approached the farmer. â€˜Are you a good farm hand?â€™ the farmer asked him.</p>

<p>â€˜Well, I can sleep when the wind blows,â€™ answered the little man.</p>

<p>Although puzzled by this answer, the farmer, desperate for help, hired him.</p>

<p>The little man worked well around the farm, busy from dawn to dusk, and the farmer felt satisfied with the manâ€™s work.</p>

<p>Then one night the wind howled loudly in from offshore.</p>

<p>Jumping out of bed, the farmer grabbed a lantern and rushed next door to the hired handâ€™s sleeping quarters. He shook the little man and yelled, â€˜Get up! A storm is coming!</p>

<p>Tie things down before they blow away!â€™ The little man rolled over in bed and said firmly, â€˜No sir. I told you, I can sleep when the wind blows.â€™</p>

<p>Enraged by the response, the farmer was tempted to fire him on the spot. Instead, he hurried outside to prepare for the storm. To his amazement, he discovered that all of the haystacks had been covered with tarpaulins. The cows were in the barn, the chickens were in the coops, and the doors were barred. The shutters were tightly secured. Everything was tied down. Nothing could blow away. The farmer then understood what his hired hand meant, so he returned to his bed to also sleep while the wind blew.</p>

<p>When youâ€™re prepared, spiritually, mentally, and physically, you have nothing to fear. Can you sleep when the wind blows through your life?</p>

<p>The hired hand in the story was able to sleep because he had secured the farm against the storm.</p>

<p>The above story goes on to talk about trials and tribulations in life and if we do our best to understand, accept, and implement the principles learnt by us we will experience a deep sense of security, peace, and joy from within.  We will then be able to â€˜sleep when the wind blows.â€™</p>
