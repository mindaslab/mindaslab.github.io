    <p>I am an Engineer and I would like to be one. An engineer is basically a scientists who applies science to do a task, most probably to make people smile, or in some case to make people weep, like in the case of weapon design. No matter what ever an engineer does there is an ethic.</p>

<p>There are ethics even for a decoit; Ben Hall for example never killed a person even though he was a decoit. He never shot a police man who came to kill him in his final hours. Weather a engineer does good or bad they must have ethics.</p>

<p>There were two ethics that were violated in Trumatics. the first, my friend Umashankar screamed at us, it was becoming evident to me that he was screaming because he was ignorant of what was going on. He wouldnâ€™t take an effort to cure it. He wouldnâ€™t trust us, or take in enough knowledge to cross verify what we were doing.</p>

<p>Second, the team, they seem to need spoon feeding and unlike adults they were quiet incapable of teaching themselves and finding things out. This made my life really difficult.</p>

<p>Treating people fair, and self-learning I feel are engineering ethics. That was not been followed in Trumatics. To make the matters worst Trumatics was nodding to absurd client requirements, possibly because of money shortage, and pressure was building up in a unnecessary way.</p>

<p>The company prior to Trumatics, named Zanec was a good one, but most people left that office because of one person called Varadarajan, aka Varda. For no reason he would make lives of of people miserable. He was a natural parasite, evolution has made him that way and there was no cure. Its like telling a cholera bacteria not to cause cholera, then it wonâ€™t be a cholera bacteria at all!</p>

<p>You just need one person to ruin the company. I donâ€™t know from where this evilness arises, but it does. Possibly only evil humans survived and thrived and they killed the good ones, so its part of our genes. May be nothing can be done about it.</p>
