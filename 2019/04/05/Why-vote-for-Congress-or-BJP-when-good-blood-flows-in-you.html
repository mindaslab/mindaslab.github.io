    <p>Many people I interact with say that they are either going to vote for Congress or the BJP. I ask “why?”. We know the history of these parties. In this blog I am going to say why you should not vote for any of them.</p>

<h2 id="promoting-killers">Promoting Killers</h2>

<p>BJP kills cow eaters and non Hindus, Congress killed Sikhs. Both parties promote the accused Narendra Modi and Kamalnath to higher ranks. These parties that have such a large gatherings can’t even find a single person who is true and untainted? That’s amazing!! and shows to their lack of strictness and lack of commitment. When families in our nation weep for their lost ones due to communal violence, all these parities could do is to promote the tainted up.</p>

<p>I am not talking about these people winning in court. Even if they have won in court, all the parties should have done is revoke their suspension and kept them as a basic worker and no more than that. Its strange that Narendra Modi and Kamalnath are irreplaceable. Its shows that these parties are unable to find a better talent in this vast India which shows their inefficiency. Should we vote for such inefficient parties?</p>

<h2 id="dynastic-politics">Dynastic politics</h2>

<p>Both BJP and Congress are dynastic according to Scroll.in, in BJP 31% of its MP’s come from some form of hereditary, and in congress its 33%. Just because we all recognize Gandhi’s we tend to assume Congress is dynastic and BJP is not.</p>

<p>Once again these parties are inefficient in selecting people to lead it. Rather than screening the nation and hand picking people who are truly interested in national welfare, these parties settle for the familiar.</p>

<p>If we citizens too settle for the familiar rather than screening candidates in our constituency, we will make our nation just another BJP and Congress.</p>

<h2 id="same-source-of-funding">Same source of funding</h2>

<p>Both the BJP and congress, if they win will get funded by very same businesses, and they will enact laws that will benefit few oligarchic rich and will ignore us. So whats the difference?</p>

<h2 id="scams">Scams</h2>

<p>Both parties are scandalous. Just because BJP ruled for only few 10+ years, their looting are less compared to around 70+ years of looting’s of congress. If we extrapolate BJP , they are nothing but congress.</p>

<h2 id="zero">Zero</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/this_guy_gets_it.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Well, Prinyka Herself admits it, and BJP didn’t deny it. The truth comes out some how.</p>

<h2 id="elect-some-one-new">Elect some one new</h2>

<p>Are you blind? Look around and bring some one new. Lets see what the new person does.</p>
